<p><span class="smcap">A new</span> and revised Edition of the following Treatise
on the superstitions and amusements of the Highlanders,
which was very favourably received by the
Public on its original publication, has often been
called for; but the Author’s urgent professional avocations
did not permit of earlier attention to the
matter. At the request of many friends and countrymen,
the Author has now, however, been induced to
reprint the present Edition, in order to record more
fully the fast-fading Tales and Traditions which lately
formed, and still to a certain extent form, the Winter’s
Evening Entertainments of the happy Highland
Homes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> part of the United Kingdom has of late years
attracted a greater portion of public attention than the
Highlands of Scotland. Formerly isolated as the inhabitants
were from their fellow subjects, by a different
language and separate interests, their character
was but little known and less admired. Devoted to
their chiefs and feudal institutions, they entertained a
sovereign contempt for their neighbours; and, in their
occasional intercourse with them, displayed feelings
and manners little calculated to gain confidence or
secure esteem.</p>

<p>But when the Rebellion in 1745, and its consequences,
nearly annihilated feudal power, and broke
down the wall of partition, by which the mountaineer
was so long divided from the inhabitant of the plain,
a new light was reflected upon his manners and habits.
The gradual establishment of commercial and friendly
relations with the inhabitants of other countries, accelerated
the decay of mutual prejudices; and the virtues
of the Highlander, which were previously reserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
for home consumption, were now duly appreciated by
the world. He no longer appeared the rude and unprincipled
depredator, but the generous and disinterested
character, whose romantic and chivalrous habits
were rendered peculiarly interesting, as the remains of
those boldly defined virtues which distinguished our
primitive ancestors. Accordingly, the genius of the
age became speedily alive to the importance of so
novel and interesting a character. Shaping its course
to the Highland mountains, it discovered among their
unexplored recesses, those plentiful materials, on which
are founded some of the most splendid works which
adorn the circle of British literature.</p>

<p>Nor have all those superstructures yet exhausted so
fertile a mine. Notwithstanding all the research that
has been employed in tracing the origin, and delineating
the manners of the inhabitants, and the many
ingenious descriptions we have had of their local scenery,
there are still many hidden treasures left for
discovery, which presently languish in obscurity. This
observation applies with great truth to those more
remote and romantic regions, which, from their secluded
situations, had been long inaccessible to the
approach of learning and genius; and where the native
inhabitants, from want of intercourse with their
more refined and effeminate countrymen, are the true
representatives of our ancient forefathers in their
various feelings and habits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>Of the manners and character of this noble and
poetic race of mountaineers, little was known further
than what may be collected from the manners of their
contemporaries, in more accessible parts of the country.
The great defect which especially exists in the
delineation of the Highlander’s superstitions, becomes
peculiarly apparent to one, who had an opportunity of
investigating those relics of the less polished ages of
the world, as they are still exhibited in the habits of
the people of whom we are writing. Many of the
more prominent and common features of this branch
of our national peculiarities have, indeed, been long
ago celebrated by the pens of the immortal Burns,
Ramsay, Sir Walter Scott, and others of less note,
while much light has been thrown on the general character
of the Scottish Highlander, by the ingenious
Mrs. Grant of Laggan, and the gallant General
Stewart of Garth; but the more interesting and latent
peculiarities have been left to expire in the dark. The
want of a complete and systematic account of the
Highland and Scottish Superstitions, is a desideratum
in our national literature, which the philosophic mind
will readily regret; and this regret will be the more
sincere on reflecting, that, from the fading aspects
those interesting relics have now assumed, it is a desideratum
which, in the course of a few years, cannot
be supplied. The decline of popular romance is keeping
pace with the progress of knowledge and civilization,—which,
as they illumine the unenlightened mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
open it to the folly of its prejudices; and thus the
time is hastening its approach, when the natives of our
remotest glens shall be no longer inspired with reverence
for the fairy turret, nor shall their social circle
be contracted by the frightful tale.</p>

<p>Far be it, however, from the writer of these pages
to wish the reign of superstition prolonged. But,
while he would hail with delight, the total extirpation
of every prejudice tending to enslave the mental
energy of the noble Gael, he would as ardently desire
their perpetuation on the page of history, as his ancient
peculiarities. Divested as they will soon be of
their formidable character, we would preserve them as
the most ancient relics we could transmit to our posterity,
to whom, in the course of a few centuries, they
may appear as preposterous and incredible, as the
Poems of Ossian do now to the more sceptical part of
the present generation.</p>

<p>It was not, however, the writer’s conviction of the
utility of such a work as this alone, that induced him
to undertake a task for which, he is afraid, he will be
found to have been ill qualified. A considerable time
ago, and at a very early period of life, an impaired state
of health rendered it necessary for him to abandon his
professional labours for a time, and to retire from the
metropolis to the place of his nativity. The lassitude
of mind consequent on a total remission from all employment,
induced him to seek some rational source of
amusement; and the idea of investigating the opinions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
and customs of his countrymen, was suggested to him
by various circumstances, as likely to afford instruction
as well as entertainment. His opportunities
were most ample, and his task of course, comparatively
easy. Surrounded by the most original, brave, and
ingenious class of Highlanders existing, and possessing
considerable knowledge of their language and manners,
the writer found it no difficult matter to become completely
acquainted with their prejudices and habits.
By visiting the most celebrated professors of traditional
lore in the district, he speedily acquired not only a
fundamental knowledge of the reigning principles of
superstition but likewise an inexhaustible store of tales
and traditions. And by mingling occasionally with the
peasantry in their public and private festivities, he was
enabled, from personal observation, to draw faithful
portraits of those scenes of mirth and festivity, for
which the inhabitants are so eminently distinguished.
The result of his observations afforded him so much
satisfaction that he thought it worth while from time
to time, to commit the particulars to paper,—not with
the view of urging them on the public, but for his own
private amusement. But the increasing avidity with
which traits of the Highland Superstitions have been
received as developed in the tales of the day, suggested
to him the idea of submitting his gleanings to the
public, in the form of a detailed account of the Superstitions
and Festivities of the Highlanders of Scotland;
and he hopes, however defective may be its execution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
the design is not altogether unworthy of public patronage.</p>

<p>To arrange his gleanings in a connected and systematic
order, was an undertaking far more tedious than
the collection of them. The traits of Highland superstition
are of so various and heterogeneous a character,
that it appeared almost wholly impracticable to connect
and digest them into the form of a connected narrative;
and yet in any other shape they would necessarily loose
much of the interest which they possess in their present
form. Sensible of this he has endeavoured to the best
of his ability, to arrange the different traits under their
proper heads, in the most systematic and connected manner
practicable, without introducing extraneous matter,
which would not only destroy the native complexion
of the subject, but also swell the limits of the work.
By excluding solemn dissertation from such ludicrous
relations as the following, he has been enabled to compress
many particulars into little space, while his delineations
possess a greater degree of truth and fidelity.
To illustrate the various traits set forth, the writer has
interspersed his delineations with a collection of the
most popular tales of the day. These tales, whether
they be the creation of the imagination, or the offspring
of the credulity of their own original authors,
cannot now fail to interest the philosopher or the antiquary,
while they may amuse the less profound. For,
utterly destitute of all probability, and broadly ludicrous
as they may appear to the polished reader, they are,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
nevertheless, those interesting channels, by which the
feelings and habits of our earliest forefathers have been
kept alive and transmitted down, through so many
changeful ages, to their posterity of the present day.</p>

<p>The length of those primitive relations is necessarily
much abridged, but a strict regard has been had
to their original style and phraseology. The language
is almost entirely borrowed from the mouth of the
Highland narrator, and translated, it is hoped, in a
manner so simple and unvarnished, as to be perfectly
intelligible to the capacity of the peasant, for whose
fire-side entertainment this little volume may, perhaps,
be peculiarly adapted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> whatever country, station, or character the
reader may be, we presume it will be unnecessary
for us, on this our outset, to intrude upon
his time by entering into a logical definition of
the term <i>Ghost</i>. There is perhaps no nation or
clime, from California to Japan, where that very
ancient and fantastic race of beings called Ghosts
is not, under different terms and different characters,
more or less familiar to the inhabitants.
We do not mean, however, to follow this fleeting
race of patriarchs throughout their wide course
of wandering and colonisation from the beginning
of time to the present day—as, in all likelihood,
our research would turn out equally arduous
and unprofitable; we confine our lucubrations
to the colony of the tribe which, from
time immemorial, have settled themselves among
the inhabitants of the Highland Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>Be it known then to the reader, that, so early
as the days of Ossian, the son of Fingal, and
ever since, ghosts have been at all times a plentiful
commodity among the hills of Caledonia.
Every native Highlander has allied to him, from
his birth, one of those airy beings in the character
of an auxiliary or helpmate, who continues
his companion, not only during all the
days of the Highlander’s life, but also for an
indefinite period of time after his decease. It
will be readily believed that this ancient class
of our mountaineers cannot have descended
through so many changeful ages of the world
without sharing, in some measure, those revolutions
of manners and habits to which all classes
and communities of people are equally liable.
Accordingly the ghost has suffered as great a
degeneracy from that majesty of person and
chivalry of habits which anciently distinguished
the primitive inhabitants of Caledonia, as his
mortal contemporary, man. Unlike the present
puny, green, worm-eaten effigies that now-a-days
stalk about our premises, and, like the cameleon,
feed upon the air, the ancient race of Highland
ghosts were a set of stout, lusty, sociable ghosts,
“<i>as tall as a pine, and as broad as a house</i>.”
Differing widely in his habits from those of his
posterity, the ghost of antiquity would enter
the habitation of man, descant a lee-long night
upon the news of the times, until the long-wished-for
supper was once prepared, when this
pattern of frankness and good living would invite
himself to the table, and do as much justice
to a bicker of Highland crowdie as his
earthly contemporaries. Indeed, if all tales be
true, many centuries are not elapsed since those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
social practices of the ghosts of the day proved
an eminent pest to society. With voracious
appetites, those greedy gormandizers were in
the habit of visiting the humble hamlets, where
superabundance of store seldom resided, and of
ravishing from the grasp of a starving progeny
the meagre fare allotted to their support.</p>

<p>Beyond their personal attractions, however,
it is believed they displayed few enviable qualities;
for, besides their continual depredations
on the goods and chattels of the adjacent hamlets,
they were ill-natured and cruel, and cared
not a spittle for woman or child. The truth of
this remark is well exemplified in the history
of two celebrated ghosts, who “<i>once upon a
time</i>” lived, or rather existed, in the Wilds of
<i>Craig-Aulnaic</i>, a romantic place in the district
of Strathdown, Banffshire. The one was a male,
and the other a female. The male was called
<i>Fhua Mhoir Bein Baynac</i>, after one of the
mountains of Glenavon, where at one time he
resided; and the female was called <i>Clashnichd
Aulnaic</i>, from her having had her abode in
<i>Craig-Aulnaic</i>. But, although the great ghost
of <i>Ben-Baynac</i> was bound, by the common ties
of nature and of honour, to protect and cherish
his weaker companion, <i>Clashnichd Aulnaic</i>, yet
he often treated her in the most cruel and unfeeling
manner. In the dead of night, when
the surrounding hamlets were buried in deep
repose, and when nothing else disturbed the
solemn stillness of the midnight scene, “oft,”
says our narrator, “would the shrill shrieks of
poor <i>Clashnichd</i> burst upon the slumberer’s ears,
and awake him to any thing but pleasant reflections.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>But of all those who were incommoded by
the noisy and unseemly quarrels of these two
ghosts, James <i>Owre</i> or Gray, the tenant of the
farm of Balbig of Delnabo, was the greatest sufferer.
From the proximity of his abode to their
haunts, it was the misfortune of himself and
family to be the nightly audience of <i>Clashnichd’s</i>
cries and lamentations, which they considered
any thing but agreeable entertainment.</p>

<p>One day, as James Gray was on his rounds
looking after his sheep, he happened to fall in
with <i>Clashnichd</i>, the Ghost of Aulnaic, with
whom he entered into a long conversation. In
the course of this conversation he took occasion
to remonstrate with her on the very disagreeable
disturbance she caused himself and family, by
her wild and unearthly cries,—cries which, he
said, few mortals could relish in the dreary hours
of midnight. Poor <i>Clashnichd</i>, by way of apology
for her conduct, gave James Gray a sad
account of her usage, detailing at full length
the series of cruelties committed upon her by
<i>Ben-Baynac</i>. From this account, it appeared
that her cohabitation with the latter was by no
means a matter of choice with <i>Clashnichd</i>; on
the contrary, it appeared that she had, for a long
time, led a life of celibacy with much comfort,
residing in a snug dwelling, as already mentioned,
in the wilds of Craig-Aulnaic; but <i>Ben-Baynac</i>
having unfortunately taken it into his head to
pay her a visit, he took a fancy, not to herself,
but her dwelling, of which, in his own name and
authority, he took immediate possession, and
soon after expelled poor <i>Clashnichd</i>, with many
stripes, from her natural inheritance; while, not
satisfied with invading and depriving her of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
just rights, he was in the habit of following her
into her private haunts, not with the view of offering
her any endearments, but for the purpose of
inflicting on her person every degrading torment
which his brain could invent.</p>

<p>Such a moving relation could not fail to affect
the generous heart of James Gray, who determined
from that moment to risk life and limb in
order to vindicate the rights and revenge the
wrongs of poor <i>Clashnichd</i> the Ghost of Craig-Aulnaic.
He therefore took good care to interrogate
his new <i>protegé</i> touching the nature of
her oppressor’s constitution, whether he was of
that <i>killable</i> species of ghost that could be shot
with a silver sixpence, or if there was any other
weapon that could possibly accomplish his annihilation.
<i>Clashnichd</i> informed him that she had
occasion to know that <i>Ben-Baynac</i> was wholly
invulnerable to all the weapons of man, with the
exception of a large mole on his left breast,
which was no doubt penetrable by silver or steel;
but that, from the specimens she had of his personal
prowess and strength, it were vain for mere
man to attempt to combat <i>Ben-Baynac</i> the great
ghost. Confiding, however, in his expertness
as an archer—for he was allowed to be the best
marksman of his age—James Gray told <i>Clashnichd</i>
he did not fear him with all his might,—that
<i>he</i> was his man; and desired her, moreover,
next time he chose to repeat his incivilities
to her, to apply to him, James Gray, for redress.</p>

<p>It was not long ere he had an opportunity of
fulfilling his promises. <i>Ben-Baynac</i> having one
night, in the want of better amusement, entertained
himself by inflicting an inhuman castigation
on <i>Clashnichd</i>, she lost no time in waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
on James Gray, with a full and particular account
of it. She found him smoking his <i>cutty</i>,
and unbuttoning his habiliments for bed; but,
notwithstanding the inconvenience of the hour,
James needed no great persuasion to induce him
to proceed directly along with <i>Clashnichd</i> to
hold a communing with their friend <i>Ben-Baynac</i>
the great ghost. <i>Clashnichd</i> was a stout sturdy
hussey, who understood the knack of travelling
much better than <i>our</i> women do. She expressed
a wish that, for the sake of expedition, James
Gray would mount himself on her ample shoulders,
a motion to which the latter agreed; and a few
minutes brought them close to the scene of <i>Ben-Baynac’s</i>
residence. As they approached his
haunt, he came forth to meet them, with looks
and gestures which did not at all indicate a cordial
welcome. It was a fine moonlight night,
and they could easily observe his actions. Poor
<i>Clashnichd</i> was now sorely afraid of the great
ghost. Apprehending instant destruction from
his fury, she exclaimed to James Gray that they
would be both dead people, and that immediately,
unless James could hit with an arrow the mole
which covered <i>Ben-Baynac’s</i> heart. This was not
so difficult a task as James had hitherto apprehended
it. The mole was as large as a common
bonnet, and yet nowise disproportioned to the
natural size of his body, for he certainly was a
great and a mighty ghost. <i>Ben-Baynac</i> cried
out to James Gray, that he would soon make
eagle’s-meat of him; and certain it is, such was
his intention, had not James Gray so effectually
stopped him from the execution of it. Raising
his bow to his eye when within a few yards of
<i>Ben-Baynac</i>, he took an important aim; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
arrow flew—it hit—a yell from <i>Ben-Baynac</i>
announced its fatality. A hideous howl re-echoed
from the surrounding mountains, responsive
to the groans of a thousand ghosts; and
<i>Ben-Baynac</i>, like the smoke of a shot, evanished
into air.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p><i>Clashnichd</i>, the Ghost of Aulnaic, now found
herself emancipated from the most abject state
of slavery, and restored to freedom and liberty,
through the invincible courage of James Gray.
Overpowered with gratitude, she fell at James
Gray’s feet, and vowed to devote the whole of
her time and talents towards his service and prosperity.
Meanwhile, being anxious to have her
remaining goods and furniture removed to her
former dwelling, whence she had been so iniquitously
expelled by <i>Ben-Baynac</i> the great ghost,
she requested of her new master the use of his
horses to remove them. James observing on
the adjacent hill a flock of deer, and wishing to
have a trial of his new servant’s sagacity or expertness,
told her those were his horses,—she was
welcome to the use of them; desiring, when she
had done with them, that she would inclose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
them in his stable. <i>Clashnichd</i> then proceeded
to make use of the horses, and James Gray
returned home to enjoy his night’s rest.</p>

<p>Scarce had he reached his arm-chair, and
reclined his cheek on his hand, to ruminate over
the bold adventure of the night, when <i>Clashnichd</i>
entered, with her “breath in her throat,”
and venting the bitterest complaints at the unruliness
of his horses, which had broken one-half
of her furniture, and caused more trouble in the
stabling of them than their services were worth.
“Oh! they are stabled, then?” inquired James
Gray. <i>Clashnichd</i> replied in the affirmative.
“Very well,” rejoined James, “they shall be
tame enough to-morrow.”</p>

<p>From this specimen of <i>Clashnichd</i> the Ghost
of Craig-Aulnaic’s expertness, it will be seen
what a valuable acquisition her service proved
to James Gray and his young family; of which,
however, they were too speedily deprived by a
most unfortunate accident. From the sequel of
the story, and of which the foregoing is but an
extract, it appears that poor <i>Clashnichd</i> was but
too deeply addicted to those guzzling propensities
which at that time rendered her kin so
obnoxious to their human neighbours. She was
consequently in the habit of visiting her friends
much oftener than she was invited, and, in the
course of such visits, was never very scrupulous
in making free with any eatables that fell within
the circle of her observation.</p>

<p>One day, while engaged on a foraging expedition
of this description, she happened to enter
the Mill of Delnabo, which was inhabited in
those days by the miller’s family. She found
the miller’s wife engaged in roasting a large gridiron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
of fine savoury fish, the agreeable effluvia
proceeding from which perhaps occasioned her
visit. With the usual inquiries after the health
of the miller and his family, <i>Clashnichd</i> proceeded,
with the greatest familiarity and good
humour, to make herself comfortable at the expense
of their entertainment. But the miller’s
wife, enraged at the loss of her fish, and not
relishing such unwelcome familiarity, punished
the unfortunate <i>Clashnichd</i> rather too severely
for her freedom. It happened that there was at
the time a large caldron of boiling water suspended
over the fire, and this caldron the beldam
of a miller’s wife overturned in <i>Clashnichd’s</i>
bosom! Scalded beyond recovery, she fled up
the wilds of Craig-Aulnaic, uttering the most
melancholy lamentations, nor has she been ever
since heard of to the present day.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br>

OF THE GHOST IN HIS CO-EXISTENT STATE—HIS PERSONAL
SIMILITUDES AND HABITS.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span>, in the preceding chapter, endeavoured,
as briefly as possible, to throw some light upon
the general character of the primitive race of
Highland ghosts in order to enable the reader
to judge of the difference of manners which distinguished
them from the modern ghosts, we shall
now proceed to the consideration of the latter
during the interval betwixt the birth and the
eve of the death of the mortal, and which, for
the sake of illustration, we shall call his co-existent
state.</p>

<p>From the birth of the mortal to the eve of his
death, the ghost, in point of similitude, is a
perfect counterpart or representative of his earthly
yoke-fellow. As the child grows towards manhood,
his ghost keeps pace with him, and so
exactly do they resemble each other in the features,
complexions, and aspect, when seen by a
third party, that, without the use of prescribed
spells, no human observer can distinguish the
mortal from the immortal. Nor is this resemblance
confined to the personal appearance alone—it
is likewise extended to the habiliments.
Whether the mortal equips himself in the Highland
garb or Lowland costume, the imitative
ghost instantly assumes the same attire. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
bonnet or the hat, the philibeg or the trews, are
equally convenient and agreeable to him; for
in this solitary particular he has never been
known to dissent from his human partner.</p>

<p>During this period the ghost is supposed
either to accompany or precede, at some distance,
his human partner (of course invisible to
those not possessing the second-sight) in all
those multifarious journeys and duties which the
mortal performs throughout the course of his
eventful life, and the moral utility of the ghost
is supposed to consist in propitiating the mortal’s
undertakings by guarding them from the influence
of evil spirits. But, however this may
be, it is a well-known fact, that <i>all</i> ghosts do
not devote the whole of their time to the discharge
of this commendable duty. Common
fame errs much if those capricious beings do not
love their own pleasures more than their partner’s
interest; and this their negligence is a
subject of still deeper regret, when we consider
the nature of those practices in which they employ
their time.</p>

<p>If the appetites of the modern ghost are better
restrained than those of his predecessors were
in the “greedy times” we have written of, the
mischievous habits he has acquired in lieu of his
predecessor’s social accomplishments are to some
far more calamitous than even <i>Clashnichd’s</i>
practices. It is true, a dose of Highland crowdie
would but ill agree with the refined delicacy
of the stomach of the former. Such squeamish
appetites must look out for more delicate and savoury
food. But if the modern ghost does not
possess those keen digestive powers which distinguished
<i>Clashnichd</i>, he inherits all the ill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
nature of <i>Ben-Baynac</i>, without one-third of
his might; and we question much if his regard
for the fair sex is a bit more tender.</p>

<p>Instead of being the peaceable and industrious
associate of his yoke-fellow, it is a common
practice with the ghost of the present day
to prowl about the country with the laudable
intention of committing all the mischief in his
power to the friends and acquaintances of his
partner. Planting himself in some wild and
convenient position, he will open on the ears
of the slumbering inhabitants, or the more unfortunate
traveller, his wild and unearthly cries,
highly gratified, no doubt, at the paralyzing
effect they produce on his audience. Of the
hideousness of these cries nothing short of auric
demonstration can convey an adequate conception.
Partaking at once of all that is horrid and unnatural,
if any resemblance to them can be figured,
we are told it is the “expiring shrieks of a goat
under the butcher’s knife, or the howling of a
dog in a solitary cavern.” Proportioned to the
strength of the ghost, the cry is loud or faint, and
has something so peculiar in it, that the least
note never fails to give the hearer a temporary
palsy.</p>

<p>But were his practices confined to those comparatively
harmless proceedings, the conduct of
the ghost would be far less intolerable than it
is. His vocal entertainments, however hurtful
they sometimes prove to those unfortunate
enough to hear them, are not sufficiently iniquitous
to satisfy the extent of his malice. Being,
no doubt, well disciplined in the noble and
fashionable art of pugilism by long experience
and practice among his kindred species, never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
remarkable for their social harmony, he is,
perhaps, the best bruiser in the universe, and
will never be backward in showing those people
who come in his way his expertness in
this science. As, however, the greatest part
of his human contemporaries are, perhaps,
too <i>strikingly</i> convinced of his decided superiority,
few of them are disposed to hazard a
<i>set-to</i> with so pithy a combatant, and it is consequently
no easy matter for the ghost to fall in
with those who are inclined to fight merely for
fighting’s sake. Finding, therefore, so few willing
to quarrel with him in that open and gentlemanlike
manner usual in those countries, the
fertility of his noddle suggests to him the more
indirect or Irish mode of proceeding; and it is to
this ingenious mode of raising a row that the
Modern Ghost owes the most of his laurels.
Presenting himself before the unsuspecting traveller
in the servile appearance of a scabbed colt,
or some such equally contemptible animal, he
will in this guise place himself in the passenger’s
way, as if to graze by the road’s side. Raising
his staff, the passenger will very aptly apply it
to the colt’s back to clear his way, when the
malicious animal will instantly retort, and a conflict
ensues, in which the unwary transgressor is
severely punished for his indiscretion.</p>

<p>In former times, however, and even in recent
times, we have heard of some instances where
these wanton pugilists proceeded upon more
honourable and systematic principles than they
do at present. Instead of the dastardly mode
of cajoling his adversary into a fight by stratagem,
and conquering him by surprise, the warlike
bogle of the last century carried about with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
him flails, cudgels, and such other pithy weapons
as were suitable to the spirit of the times,—and
on his meeting with a human adventurer
who had no objection to become his antagonist,
his choice of weapons was left with the latter.
Hence it followed that this equitable and impartial
mode of proceeding ended not unfrequently
to the ghost’s great disadvantage; for
the <i>human</i> bullies of those days were so diligently
trained up to the handling of a flail or the wielding
of a cudgel, that their ghostly combatants,
with all their might and dexterity, have often
been the first to propose an armistice. To multiply
details of such encounters would be as
tedious as they are numerous and similar; a
single narrative, communicated to the compiler
by the grand-nephew of the person concerned,
will, we suppose, be sufficient to confirm our
statements.</p>

<p>“Late one night, as my grand-uncle Lachlan
<i>Dhu</i> Macpherson, who was well known as the
best fiddler of his day, was returning home from
a ball, at which he had acted as a musician, he
had occasion to pass through the once haunted
Bog of Torrans. Now, it happened at that time
that that Bog was frequented by a huge bogle
or ghost, who was of a most mischievous disposition,
and took particular pleasure in abusing
every traveller who had occasion to pass through
the place betwixt the twilight at night and cock-crowing
in the morning. Suspecting much that
he would also come in for a share of his abuse,
my grand-uncle made up his mind, in the course
of his progress, to return him any <i>civilities</i> which
he might think meet to offer him. On arriving
on the spot, he found his suspicions were too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
well grounded; for whom did he see but the
Ghost of Bogandoran, apparently ready waiting
him, and seeming by his ghastly grin not a little
overjoyed at the meeting? Then marching up
to my grand-uncle, the bogle clapt a huge club
into his hand, and furnishing himself with one
of the same dimensions, he put a spittle in his
hand, and deliberately commenced the combat.
My grand-uncle returned the salute with equal
spirit, and so ably did both parties ply their
batons, that for a while the issue of the combat
was extremely doubtful. At length, however,
the fiddler could easily discover that his opponent’s
vigour was much in the fagging order. Picking
up renewed courage in consequence, my grand-uncle,
the fiddler, plied the ghost with renovated
vigour, and after a stout resistance, in the course
of which both parties were seriously handled,
the Ghost of Bogandoran thought it prudent to
give up the night.</p>

<p>“At the same time, filled, no doubt, with great
indignation at this signal defeat, it seems the
ghost resolved to re-engage my grand-uncle on
some other occasion, under more favourable circumstances.
Not long after, as my grand-uncle
was returning home quite unattended from another
ball in the Braes of the country, he had
just entered the hollow of Auldichoish, well
known for its ‘<i>eery</i>’ properties, when lo! who
presented himself to his view on the adjacent
eminence but his old friend of Bogandoran, advancing
as large as the gable of a house, putting
himself in the most threatening and fighting
attitudes?</p>

<p>“Looking on the very dangerous nature of the
ground in which they were met, and feeling no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
anxiety for a second encounter with a combatant
of his weight, in a situation so little desirable,
the fiddler would have willingly deferred the
settlement of their differences till a more convenient
season. He, accordingly, assuming the
most submissive aspect in the world, endeavoured
to pass by his champion in peace, but in vain.
Longing, no doubt, to retrieve the disgrace of
his late discomfiture, the bogle instantly seized
the fiddler, and attempted with all his might to
pull the latter down the precipice, with the diabolical
intention, it is supposed, of drowning him
in the river Avon below. In this pious design
the bogle was happily frustrated by the intervention
of some trees which grew in the precipice,
and to which my unhappy grand-uncle clung
with the zeal of a drowning man. The enraged
ghost finding it impossible to extricate him from
those friendly trees, and resolving, at all events,
to be revenged of him, he fell upon maltreating
the fiddler with his hands and feet in the most
inhuman manner.</p>

<p>“Such gross indignities my worthy grand-uncle
was not accustomed to, and being incensed
beyond all measure at the liberties taken by Bogandoran,
he resolved again to try his mettle,
whether life or death should be the consequence.
Having no other weapon wherewith to defend
himself but his <i>biodag</i>, which, considering the
nature of his opponent’s constitution, he suspected
much would be of little avail to him—I say, in
the absence of any other weapon, he sheathed
the <i>biodag</i> three times in the Ghost of Bogandoran’s
belly. And what was the consequence?
why, to the great astonishment of my courageous
forefather, the ghost fell down cold-dead at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
his feet, and was never more seen or heard
of.”</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that in those chivalrous
days the stout and energetic sons of Caledonia
had courage and prowess enough to cope with
those powerful warriors, however unequally
matched, with spirit and even with success. In
the present effeminate times, we hear of none
that will even contend with those miserable scarecrows
of the present day. Overcome, more by
fear than by force, at the first encounter they
throw themselves down, and, like the lamb beneath
the fox, tamely submit to the most abusive
treatment. Hence, encouraged by those servile
submissions, it is almost incredible to what extent
those invincible <i>corps</i> sometimes carry their
audacity. We have heard of not a few of them,
who having, in the first place, intruded their
company on peaceable travellers on the public
road, in the next place offered them the most
provoking indignities,—one time piping their
unearthly cries into the passenger’s ears, at another
time tripping him up by the heels, and even
committing indecencies which delicacy forbids
us to repeat, while the fears and agitation manifested
by the traveller constituted a subject of
great merriment to the mischievous ghost.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br>

OF THE GHOST IN HIS INTERMEDIATE STATE—HIS
SIMILITUDES AND HABITS.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A short</span> time previous to the mortal’s death,
and when just on the eve of dissolution, the
ghost undergoes a striking revolution in his appearance
and habits. Seized with the <i>locked jaw</i>,
and all the other disabilities common to the dead,
he then becomes the awful emblem of death in
all its similitudes. Attired in a shroud and all
the ensigns of the grave, the ghost nocturnally
proceeds to the narrow house of his future residence,
and there disappears. He is lighted on
his way by a pale azure-coloured light, of the
size of that emitted by a <i>tallow</i> candle, which is
of a flickering unsteady nature, sometimes vivid,
and sometimes faint, as the mortal inhales and
respires his breath; and, in his course towards
the grave, he will follow minutely the line of
march destined to be followed by his earthly
partner’s approaching funeral. His pace is slow,
and his footsteps imperceptible even to a passenger;
who, although he sees clearly all his
trappings, cannot discern his mode of travelling.
To the naked eye the ghost’s visage is not discernible,
by reason of the <i>face-cloth</i>. There is
a very simple process, however, which has been
discovered for enabling a spectator to discern
whose ghost he is, although we never heard of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
more than one person who had the hardihood to
put the experiment in practice.</p>

<p>It is an admitted fact, in those countries, that
a ghost may be recognised, in the appearance of
his human partner, on his passing a spectator,
by the latter’s reversing the cuff of his own coat,
or any other part of his raiment, which puts an
instant stop to the ghost’s career, and clearly
exposes him to the recognition of the courageous
experimenter.</p>

<p>A sage philosopher, who had long desired an
opportunity of practising this bold experiment,
found, “late one night,” when returning home
from a market, a very convenient one. Observing
a stout lusty ghost stalking very majestically
along the public road, this bold adventurer hesitated
not a moment. Clapping himself into
a defensive attitude, he reversed his cuff—when,
lo! his next-door neighbour’s wife was instantly
confronted to his face—clad in death’s awful
apparel—the death-candle lowing in her throat,
and mouth full distended. Such an exhibition
was too appalling to wish for a long interview;
and, accordingly, Donald Doul, the adventurer,
made a motion to be off, but in vain. The unhappy
man, as if transformed into a stone, could
no more move than Lot’s wife, and was obliged
to stand confronted to his loving companion,
both equally sparing of their talk, until the crowing
of the cock in the morning. Finding himself
then released from his uncomfortable stance, he
was about to make the best of his way home, to
communicate the result of his experiment, when
the friendly wife’s ghost thus addressed him:
“Donald Doul—Donald Doul—Donald Doul—hear
me, and tremble. Great is the hindrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
you have caused me this night,—a hindrance for
which you should have been severely punished,
but for the friendship which formerly subsisted
between yourself and my partner. Dare not
again to pry into the mysteries of the dead. The
time will come when you’ll know those secrets.”
To this poetical harangue Donald Doul made
no other reply than a profound obeisance. It
is possible, however, the ghost would have proposed
a rejoinder, had not a chanticleer, in the
adjacent hamlet, emitted his third clarion, at the
magic sound of which the wife’s ghost fairly took
to her heels, leaving Donald Doul to resume his
course homewards without further advice. Satisfied
of the interesting nature of the occurrence,
and that his reputation for courage and veracity
would suffer no diminution from the relation,
Donald Doul made no secret of what happened.
This clearly foretold what speedily took place,
the dissolution of the neighbour’s wife, (who, by
the way, was dangerously ill at the time,) to the
great grief of her husband, and the credit of
Donald Doul’s name.</p>

<p>A short time after the ghost, bearing the
death-candle, has thus been seen, the house of
the undertaker who is to make the mortal’s
coffin will be nightly disturbed by the sounds of
saws and knocking of hammers, no doubt proceeding
from the ghost of the undertaker and
his assistants preparing the coffin of the ghost;
while invisible messengers will parade the country
for necessaries for the ghost’s funeral, or
foregoing. And a very imposing and interesting
spectacle may be looked for.</p>

<p>The mortal resigns his breath, and is about to
follow the course of the dead-candle to his new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
abode, when <i>Taish na Tialedh</i>, or the funeral
foregoing, takes the road. This is not a paltry
spectacle of one ghost, a sight so common in
those countries, but a superb assemblage of
them, all drest in their best attire, each reflecting
lustre on the other. On this occasion, the
ghost of every man who is destined to accompany
the mortal’s funeral will attend, dressed
in apparel of the same colour, and mounted on
a horse of the same appearance, (if he is to have
one,) as his mortal companion on the day of the
corporeal interment. On this occasion, too,
their characteristic austerity of manners is dispensed
with. Mellowed, no doubt, by the generous
qualities of the <i>Usquebaugh</i>, the jocund
laugh, the jest, and repartee, go slapping round,
responsive to some mournful dirge proceeding
from the defunct’s immediate friends and relations.</p>

<p>In the motley group, the ghost of a father or
brother is easily recognised by his well-known
voice and Sabbath vestment. Nay, the spectator
may even recognise himself, if his senses enable
him to discriminate, joyous or sorry, as occasion
suggests, mingling in the throng. In the
middle of the procession the coffin is seen, containing,
we presume, the <i>dead ghost</i>, circled by
mourning relatives; and on the front, flanks,
and rear of the burden, the company are likewise
seen approaching and retiring, relieving
each other by turns. At length, the noise of
horses and tongues, horsemen and footmen,
mingled indiscriminately together, closes the
procession.</p>

<p>The following account of the <i>foregoing</i> of the
funeral of an illustrious chief, who died some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
few score of years ago, (witnessed by a man
whose veracity was a perfect proverb,) will not,
we trust, be unacceptable:</p>

<p>“A smith, who had a large family to provide
for, was often necessitated to occupy his smithy
till rather a late hour. One night, in particular,
as he was turning the key of his smithy
door, his notice was attracted to the public road,
which lay contiguous to the smithy, by a confusion
of sounds, indicative of the approach of a
great concourse of people. Immediately there
appeared the advanced ranks of a procession,
marching four men deep, in tolerable good order,
unless occasionally some unaccountable circumstance
occasioned the fall of a lusty fellow,
as if he had been shot by a twenty-four pounder.
Thunderstruck at the nature and number of
the marvellous procession, the smith, honest
man, reclined his back to the door, witnessing a
continuation of the same procession for nearly
an hour, without discovering any thing further
of the character of those who composed it, than
that they betokened a repletion of the <i>Usquebaugh</i>.
At length, the appearance of the hearse
and its awful ensigns, together with the succeeding
line of coaches, developed the nature of the
concern. It was then that the smith’s knees
began to smite each other, and his hair to stand
on an end. The recent demise of this venerable
chieftain confirmed his conviction of its being a
<i>Taish</i>, and a very formidable one too. Not
choosing to see the rear, he directed his face
homewards, whither he fled with the swiftness
of younger years, and was not backward in favouring
his numerous acquaintances with a full
and particular account of the whole scene. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
induced many honest people to assume the
smithy door as their stance of observation on
the day of the funeral, which took place a few
days after; and, to his honour be it told, every
circumstance detailed by the smith in his relation
accurately happened, even to the decanting
of two dogs, and this established the smith’s
veracity in all time thereafter.”</p>

<p>Akin to this are all the relations of those good
people whose evil destiny it has been to fall in
with those ghostly processions, some of whom
having inadvertently involved themselves into
the crowd, were repulsed in every attempt to
extricate themselves, until carried along, nobody
knows how far, by the tumultuous rabble, who
seemed to enjoy themselves vastly at the standing
hair, protruding eyes, and awry visage of
the unconscious intruder.</p>

<p>In concluding this part of our subject, it is
hardly necessary to add, that in two or three
days after the ghostly procession, the human or
corporeal procession will succeed it, following
most minutely and accurately every course,
winding, and turn taken by the foregoing, while
the dress, conversation, and every other incident
attending the company will be precisely the
same.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br>

OF THE GHOST IN HIS POST-EXISTENT STATE.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> might, no doubt, be readily supposed by the
ingenious reader, that the mortal’s decease
should be the term of dissolution assigned to the
copartnery connection subsisting between the
mortal and his ghost, as it generally terminates
every other engagement into which the people
of this world enter. The event, however, only
serves to blend their interests still more strictly
together. Whatever doubt may exist as to the
ghost’s attention to his partner’s worldly interests
in his lifetime, his solicitude for his spiritual
interest, after the mortal’s death, is universally
acknowledged. He then becomes the sole means
of remedying past errors, and obtaining redress
for past injuries. To enable one fully to appreciate
a ghost’s utility in the “land of the leal,”
he must acquaint himself with the nature of the
life which the defunct led, whether regular in
his habits and moral in his life, or otherwise,
and the particular situation of his affairs at
death. If, for instance, a man falls suddenly,
like a tree in a storm, whatever may be the situation
or circumstances in which he happens to
drop, so he must lie. In this respect, then, the
peculiar advantage of the Highlander over his
Lowland neighbour becomes perfectly apparent.
Through the medium of a faithful ghost and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
confidential friend, transactions, as intricate and
ravelled as those of the Laird of Coul, can be
easily simplified and assorted.</p>

<p>No man should, therefore, be surprised, if the
ghost of some departed friend should take an
opportunity of saluting him, and for his own
sake he should also lose no time in enabling the
awful emissary to declare the purpose of his
mission; whoever will defer doing so only increases
his own misery, and it is a task, however
uncomfortable, that is sacredly due to departed
friendship; for how many, by yielding to the influence
of cowardly fear, have exposed themselves
and their household to those nocturnal
rackets sometimes raised by those disappointed
ambassadors, whereas a little resolution would
not only have averted it, but have also greatly
conduced to the repose and quietude of an old
and esteemed acquaintance. The following
statement of a circumstance which, we are told,
happened in Strathspey not a great many years
ago, will best enforce this counsel:</p>

<p>“Not many years ago there lived in Kincardine
of Strathspey a poor man, who contracted
a severe and sudden illness, which, to the great
grief of his family, terminated in his death.
From the suddenness of the honest man’s call,
he had not time to settle his affairs, and this circumstance,
it seems, as might have been supposed,
caused him no small disquietude in the
eternal world. He wished, in particular, to have
had an axe and a whisky barrel, which he had
borrowed of a friend, restored to him; for iron,
you must know, in such cases, is very bad. In
order, therefore, to have this matter adjusted,
the dead man commissioned his ghost to wait on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
a particular friend to disclose to him the circumstance,
not doubting in the least but the friend
would have bestowed his best attention on the
subject. The faithful ghost lost no time in proceeding
to get the object of his mission accomplished,
which, however, turned out rather a
difficult undertaking, for it was no easy matter
for the ghost to procure a conference with the
friend on the business. One glimpse of the
former never failed to communicate to the latter
the feet of a roe, nor could all his dexterity bring
the matter to a bearing. At length, exasperated
by a long course of night watching and useless
travelling, the wily commissioner had recourse
to an expedient which ultimately effected his
purpose. As soon as the sun went down every
evening, the ghost opened a cannonade of bricks
and stones upon the unhappy friend and the inmates
of his house, which did not terminate till
cock-crowing in the morning; and so expert an
archer was this pawky ghost, that he scarcely
ever missed an aim, while every stroke would
kill a bullock. Smarting under the effect of this
unseasonable chastisement, the friend and his
family raised the most outrageous clamour at
their unaccountable misfortune, which induced
some of their neighbours nightly to assemble in
considerable bodies to protect them from this
nocturnal warfare. But the wily ghost, far from
relaxing his operations on that account, only
plied them with additional vigour, sparing neither
sex nor age in his sweeping career. All sorts of
missiles announced themselves, rebounding on
the shoulders of the protectors as well as the
protected, the pithy weight of which, and the
unaccountable manner in which they were flung,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
convinced the sufferers they were not flung by
mortal hand. All the acquaintances of the friend,
therefore, urged on him to challenge the invisible
demon who thus savagely persecuted him at the
hour of midnight, in order to afford the latter
an opportunity of explaining his business, and
the reason of his cruel and unchristian conduct.
But this advice the friend of the deceased was
disposed to consider a dernier resort, and one
that required some cool consideration. At
length, rendered quite desperate by a series of
unparalleled persecutions, which rendered him
as thin in body as a silver sixpence, the goodman
came to a final determination to call the
ghost to account the very first opportunity, for
his mean and pusillanimous attacks on himself
and poor family. Accordingly, one night, on
receiving a tart pill on the cheek, which gave him
an ear-ache, and which wonderfully improved his
courage, the goodman marched forth, with a
mixture of rage and fear, demanding of the unfeeling
ghost, in a voice resembling the falling
notes of the gamut, ‘Wha-a-t i-i-s you-r bus-n-ess
wi’ m-my ho-use a-and fa-fa-fa-mi-ly?’
The ghost instantly appeared happy to answer
the question; but, ere he could do so, it was
necessary to go through a ceremony, which is no
less curious than it is disagreeable to the feelings
of the parties concerned. This ceremony consists
in the <i>mortal’s</i> embracing the ghost, and raising
his feet from the ground, so as to allow the wind
to pass between the soles of his feet and the
ground, which enables the tongue-tied ghost to
speak a volume. What was then to be done in
this particular case? Encouraged by the eloquent
cheers and arguments held forth to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
through the crevices of his house, by his anxious
family, he made several attempts to encircle the
awful emissary in his arms, which, by a sort of
mechanical motion, receded from the embrace;
and it was not without great difficulty he could
persuade himself to give a friendly embrace to
this mischievous ghost; this, however, he did at
last,—seizing him as he would a bush of thorns.
The ghost’s long-locked jaws now began to speak
in so sepulchral a tone as to palsy all who heard
it. The friend of the deceased promised strict
attention to all the ghost’s injunctions, upon
which he evanished in a flame of fire, leaving the
unhappy man scarce able to totter to his chair.
A minute compliance with all his instructions
rendered a second visit from the ghost unnecessary—and
this was no small matter of comfort
to the friend.”</p>

<p>This frigid display of a Highlandman’s courage
will appear very contemptible when compared
to the undaunted resolution of the female alluded
to in the following story:</p>

<p>“About forty or fifty years ago, a native of
Strathdown, whose manner of living (like that
of other folks) did not qualify him for a sudden
death, was unfortunately drowned in the following
manner: While in the act of cutting down
a tree, in a steep precipice pending over the river
Avon, he slipped his footing—fell headlong into
the abyss below, and rose no more. His lamentable
fate was speedily discovered, his body interred,
and his affairs arranged in the best possible
order. Time, the parent of oblivion, soon
rendered his name extinct among the living, and
he was no longer heard of; when, on a certain
day, in the height of it, the deceased appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
in his human likeness at the window of a female
friend. On the woman’s exhibiting some surprise
and terror at his appearance, the drowned
man called to her to fear nothing, but to come
forth and speak with him,—for it seems he had
been enabled to speak without the ‘<i>dead-lift</i>.’
The honest woman suspecting, no doubt, that,
if she did not go out to him, he would make the
best of his way to her, obeyed his summons; and,
in the course of a long convoy she gave him, he
divulged to her several acts of misconduct he
had been guilty of towards an old master and
some others, which disturbed much his repose.
Anxious, no doubt, to get rid of his company,
she promised to exert the best of her endeavours
to atone for his misconduct, on condition
he would leave her, and never again renew
his visit,—a promise which she faithfully performed,
and the dead friend gave her no farther
trouble.”</p>

<p>But the settlement of unassorted affairs, after
death, is not the only thing in which the ghost
is extremely useful. As an ambassador ever
ready to discharge any piece of useful service—such
as appeasing the unavailing grief of lamenting
relatives—he is ever ready and expert, and
the delicate manner in which the ghost sometimes
executes this commission indicates that
he is far more friendly and conciliatory in his
behaviour when <i>dead</i> than he was when alive.
Sometimes, but rarely, he leaves his abode to
benefit an old acquaintance or friend of his
partner; but it will no doubt be done at the
instigation of the devoted latter. We present
the particulars of a favour of this sort conferred
on an inhabitant of Strathspey, no doubt a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
time ago, which deserved a better return than
what the ghost at first met with.</p>

<p>“Engaged one night in the arrangement of
his farming affairs, a certain farmer, living in
the parish of Abernethy, was a good deal surprised
at seeing an old acquaintance, who had a
considerable time previously departed this life,
entering quite coolly at his dwelling-house door.
Instead of following his old acquaintance into
his house, to receive an explanation from himself
of the marvellous circumstance, his curiosity
led him into the church-yard where his friend
was buried, and which was near by, to see if he
had actually risen from the dead. On examination,
he not only found the grave, but also the
coffin <i>wide open</i>, which left no doubt on his
mind of the reality of the vision which he thought
had deluded his sight. Making the sign of the
cross on the grave, he returned to his house, not
caring whether he found his friend before him
or not. He was not, however, to be seen; but,
in the course of a short time, he returned, and
upbraided the farmer for his improper interference
with his grave, explaining to him the cause
of his resurrection. It appeared that a scabbed
stirk, which had a greedy custom of prowling
about the doors, seeking what he might devour,
thief-like entering the dwelling-house in the absence
of the family, and, finding no better subject
of entertainment, attacked the straw in the
cradle which stood by the fireside, and in which
his only child was sleeping at the time. The
tugging of the stirk at the straw would have inevitably
overturned the cradle and the child into
the fire but for the generous interposition of the
ghost. The farmer expressed his most grateful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
acknowledgments for so signal an instance of his
kindness; and immediately retraced his steps to
the grave, on which he made a counter-sign to
that which he formerly made, and the good-hearted
ghost obtained admission into his dreary
abode.”</p>

<p>But these are not all the ghost’s useful qualities.
He possesses another very important one
in this unchristian and uncharitable age, in which
the repositories of the dead are exposed to the
nocturnal spoliation of the ruthless resurrectionist.
It is vain for the church-sexton to plant
<i>steel-traps</i> and <i>spring-guns</i> in the field of his
labours,—the wily depredator will contrive to
elude them all when the vigilant watchman is
wanted to direct them. To show the vigilance
of this agent’s attention to his own interest, and
that of his friends, on such occasions, take the
following narration:—</p>

<p>“There was at one time a woman, who lived
in Camp-del-more of Strathavon, whose cattle
were seized with a murrain, or some such fell
disease, which ravaged the neighbourhood at the
time, carrying off great numbers of them daily.
All the <i>forlorn fires and hallowed waters</i> failed
of their customary effects; and she was at length
told by the wise people whom she consulted on
the occasion, that it was evidently the effect of
some infernal agency, the power of which could
not be destroyed by any other means than the
never-failing specific—the juice of a <i>dead head</i>
from the church-yard,—a nostrum certainly very
difficult to be procured, considering the head
must needs be abstracted from a grave in the
hour of midnight. Being, however, a woman of
a stout heart and strong faith, native feelings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
delicacy towards the blessed sanctuary of the
dead had more weight in restraining her for some
time from resorting to this desperate remedy
than those of fear. At length, seeing that her
bestial stock would soon be completely annihilated
by the destructive career of the disease,
the wife of Camp-del-more resolved to put the
experiment in practice, whatever the result might
be. Accordingly, having, with considerable difficulty,
engaged a neighbouring woman to be
her companion in this hazardous expedition,
they set out, about midnight, for the parish
church-yard, distant about a mile and a half from
her residence, to execute her determination. On
arriving at the church-yard, her companion,
whose courage was not so notable, appalled by
the gloomy prospect before her, refused to enter
among the habitations of the dead. She, however,
agreed to remain at the gate till her friend’s
business was accomplished. This circumstance,
however, did not stagger our heroine’s resolution.
She, with the greatest coolness and intrepidity,
proceeded towards what she supposed an old
grave,—took down her spade, and commenced
her operations. After a good deal of toil she
arrived at the object of her labour. Raising the
first head, or rather skull, that came in her way,
she was about to make it her own property,
when, lo! a hollow, wild, sepulchral voice exclaimed,
‘That is <i>my</i> head—let it alone!’ Not
wishing to dispute the claimant’s title to this
head, and supposing she could be otherwise provided,
she very good-naturedly returned it, and
took up another. ‘That is my father’s head,’
bellowed the same voice. Wishing, if possible,
to avoid disputes, the wife of Camp-del-more took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
up another head, when the same voice instantly
started a claim to it as his grand-father’s head.
‘Well,’ replied the wife, nettled at her disappointments,
‘although it were your grand-mother’s
head, you shan’t get it till I am done with
it.’—‘What do you say, you limmer?’ says the
ghost, starting up in his awry habiliments;
‘What do you say, you limmer?’ repeated he
in a great rage. ‘By the great oath, you had
better leave my grand-father’s head.’ Upon
matters coming this length, the wily wife of
Camp-del-more thought it proper to assume a
more conciliatory aspect. Telling the claimant
the whole particulars of the predicament in which
she was placed by the foresaid calamity, she
promised faithfully, that, if his Honour would
only allow her to carry off his grand-father’s
skull, or head, in a peaceable manner, she would
restore it again when done with it. Here, after
some communing, they came to an understanding,
and she was allowed to take the head along
with her, on condition she should restore it before
cock-crowing, under the heaviest penalties.</p>

<p>“On coming out of the church-yard, and looking
for her companion, she had the mortification
to find her ‘without a mouthful of breath in her
body;’ for, on hearing the dispute between her
friend and the guardian of the grave, and suspecting
much that she was likely to share the
unpleasant punishments with which he threatened
her friend, at the bare recital of them she
fell down in a faint, from which it was no easy
matter to recover her. This proved no small
inconvenience to Camp-del-more’s wife, as there
were not above two hours to elapse ere she had
to return the head in terms of her agreement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Taking her friend upon her back, she carried her
up a steep acclivity to the nearest adjoining
house, where she left her for the night; then
repaired home with the utmost speed—made
<i>dead bree</i> of the <i>dead head</i>, and, ere the appointed
time had expired, she restored the head to its
guardian, and placed the grave in its former condition.
It is needless to add, that, as a reward
for her exemplary courage, the ‘<i>bree</i>’ had its
desired effect—the cattle speedily recovered—and,
so long as she retained any of it, all sorts
of diseases were of short duration.”</p>

<h4>SAFEGUARDS FROM GHOSTS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> now briefly described the leading features
of a ghost’s character in those countries,
we shall close our account of him by annexing
a few of those safeguards which protect us from
those wanton encounters and impertinent interferences
which we have related, and which must
be far from being palatable to the more effeminate
inhabitants of the Highland mountains at
the present day.</p>

<p>One simple plan of obtaining perfect security
from supernatural agents of any kind is, (whenever
we apprehend the approach or presence of
a ghost,) to repeat certain words, which can be
taught by any wise patriarch or matron, the
powerful charm of which instantly repercusses
the ghost back to his own proper abode, and,
for the time, defeats all his machinations.
Note—If in the house, the words must be repeated
three times behind the door. A ghost
then can neither enter at the door, window, nor
any other crevice of the house. The operation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
of the words is like that of an infeftment, which,
taken on one part of the property, affects the
whole. Were it not for this grand discovery,
vain would be the attempt of any man to bar out
a ghost as he might do a <i>mortal</i>. A ghost can
enter in at the key-hole—nay, even through the
wall of the house, if there is no other caveat to
arrest him in his career.</p>

<p>Another safeguard consists in forming a piece
of the <i>rowan tree</i> into the shape of a cross with
a red thread. This cross you will insert between
the lining and cloth of your garment, and, so
long as it lasts, neither ghost nor witch shall
ever interfere with you.</p>

ORIGIN AND GENEALOGY OF THE FAIRIES.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> the ghost is confessedly entitled to no
small degree of consideration from his intimate
connection with our own species, no one will
pretend to deny that the fairy is a character
whose <i>greatness of descent</i> renders him equally
interesting and respectable. The genealogy of
the ghost can no doubt be traced back to the
earliest ages of the world, and it is pretty certain
that he has been amongst the first of its inhabitants;
still, on the score of antiquity, he cannot
pretend to compete with the fairy, who, it seems,
existed long before the world itself. The origin
and descent of the fairies, which had so long
proved such knotty subjects of controversy in
other quarters of the kingdom, are points which
have been finally settled and disposed of in these
countries. No doubt now remains, in the minds
of those who have bestowed any attention on
the important subject, of there being those unhappy
angels whose diabolical deeds produced
their expulsion from Paradise. In support of
this rational theory, the wise men of the day
never fail to quote the highest authority. Scripture,
they say, tells us those angels were cast
down; and although, indeed, it does not mention
to what place, sad experience proves the fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
that the Highland mountains received an ample
share of them. Here, wandering up and down,
like the hordes of Tartary, they pitch their camp
where spoil is most plentiful; and taking advantage
of the obstinate incredulity of some of their
human neighbours, contrive to make themselves
perfectly comfortable at the latter’s expense.
To dispel any doubt that may remain on the
mind of the reader as to the soundness of this
doctrine, we present him with the following
particulars:</p>

<p>“Not long since, as a pious clergyman was
returning home, after administering spiritual
consolation to a dying member of his flock, it
was late of the night, and he had to pass through
a good deal of <i>uncanny</i> ground. He was, however,
a good and conscientious minister of the
gospel, and feared not all the spirits in the
country. On his reaching the end of a lake
which stretched alongst the road-side for some
distance, he was a good deal surprised to have his
attention arrested by the most melodious strains
of music. Overcome by pleasure and curiosity,
the minister coolly sat down to listen to the harmonious
sounds, and try what new discoveries
he could make with regard to their nature and
source. He had not sitten many minutes when
he could distinguish the approach of the music,
and also observe a light in the direction from
whence it proceeded, gliding across the lake towards
him. Instead of taking to his heels, as
any faithless wight would have done, the pastor,
fearless, determined to await the issue of the
phenomenon. As the light and music drew
near, the clergyman could at length distinguish
an object resembling a human being walking on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
the surface of the water, attended by a group of
diminutive musicians, some of them bearing
lights, and others of them instruments of music,
on which they continued to perform those melodious
strains which first attracted his attention.
The leader of the band dismissed his
attendants, landed on the beach, and afforded the
minister the amplest opportunities of examining
his appearance. He was a little primitive-looking
grey-headed man, clad in the most grotesque
habit he ever witnessed, and such as led the
venerable minister all at once to suspect his real
character. He walked up to the minister, whom
he saluted with great grace, offering an apology
for his intrusion. The pastor returned his compliments,
and, without farther explanation, invited
the mysterious stranger to sit down by his
side. The invitation was complied with, upon
which the minister proposed the following question:
‘<i>Who art thou, stranger, and from
whence?</i>’ To this question the fairy, with
downcast eye, replied, that he was one of those
sometimes called ‘<i>Doane Shee</i>, or men of peace,
or good men, though the reverse of this title was
a more fit appellation for them. Originally
angelic in his nature and attributes, and once a
sharer of the indescribable joys of the regions of
light, he was seduced by Satan to join him in his
mad conspiracies; and as a punishment for his
transgression, he was cast down from those regions
of bliss, and was now doomed, along with
millions of fellow-sufferers, to wander through
seas and mountains, until the coming of the great
day; what their fate would be then they could
not divine, but they apprehended the worst.
And,’ continued he, turning to the minister, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
great anxiety, ‘the object of my present intrusion
on you is to learn your opinion, as an eminent
divine, as to our final condition on that
dreadful day.’ Here the venerable pastor entered
upon a long conversation with the fairy,
(the particulars of which we shall be excused
for omitting,) touching the principles of faith
and repentance. Receiving rather unsatisfactory
answers to his questions, the minister desired
the ‘<i>Sheech</i>’ to repeat after him the Paternoster;
in attempting to do which, it was not a little
remarkable that he could not repeat the word
‘<i>art</i>,’ but ‘<i>wert</i>,’ in heaven. Inferring from
every circumstance that their fate was extremely
precarious, the minister resolved not to puff the
fairies up with presumptuous and perhaps groundless
expectations. Accordingly, addressing himself
to the unhappy fairy, who was all anxiety
to know the nature of his sentiments, the reverend
gentleman told him that he could not take
it upon him to give them any hopes of pardon,
as their crime was of so deep a hue as scarcely
to admit of it. On this the unhappy fairy uttered
a shriek of despair, plunged headlong into
the loch, and the minister resumed his course to
his home.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br>

SIMILITUDE OF THE FAIRY.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the different species of supernatural tribes
which inhabit those countries, none of them
could ever vie with the fairy community for personal
elegance. Indeed, this seems to be the
only remaining vestige they possess of their primitive
character. Though generally low in stature,
they are exceedingly well proportioned,
and prepossessing in their persons. The females,
in particular, are said to be the most enchanting
beings in the world, and far beyond what the
liveliest fancy can paint. Eyes sparkling as the
brightest of the stars, or the polished gem of
Cairngorm,—cheeks in which the whiteness of
the snow and red of the reddan are blended with
the softness of the Cannoch down,—lips like the
coral, and teeth like the ivory,—a redundant
luxuriance of auburn hair hanging down the
shoulders in lovely ringlets, and a gainly simplicity
of dress, always of the colour of green, are
prominent features in the description of a Highland
fairy nymph.</p>

<p>But while we agree in some measure with our
fellow historians who have described the fairy
race as they exist in other quarters of the country,
in so far as regards their personal beauty,
we widely differ from those historians as to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
splendour of their dress as exhibited in the character
of the Highland fairies. Instead of the
gorgeous habiliments of “white and gold dropped
with diamonds, and coats of the threads of
gold,” which we are told are worn by those more
luxurious and refined fairies living within the
sphere of splendour and fashion in the Lowlands
of Scotland; the Highland fairies, more thrifty
and less voluptuous, clothe themselves in plain
worsted green, not woven by the “<i>shuttle of
Iris</i>,” but by the greasy shuttle of some Highland
weaver. This description, let it be understood,
however, applies only to the portion of
them inhabiting <i>terra firma</i>; for the dress of
those whose lot it was to fall in the deep is of
a very different nature, consisting entirely of
seal-skins, and such other <i>marine</i> apparel as is
most suitable and appropriate to their element.</p>

<p>The following story will throw some light
upon the manners and <i>habits</i> of this portion of
the fairy tribes.</p>

<p>There was once upon a time a man who lived
on the northern coasts, not far from “<i>Taigh
Jan Crot Callow</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> and he gained his livelihood
by catching and killing fish, of all sizes and denominations.
He had a particular liking to the
killing of those wonderful beasts, half dog half
fish, called “Roane,” or Seals, no doubt because
he got a long price for their skins, which are not
less curious than they are valuable. The truth
is, that most of these animals are neither dogs
nor cods, but downright fairies, as this narration
will show; and, indeed, it is easy for any man
to convince himself of the fact by a simple examination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
of his <i>tobacco-spluichdan</i>,—for the
dead skins of those beings are never the same
for four-and-twenty hours together. Sometimes
the “<i>spluichdan</i>” will erect its bristles almost
perpendicularly, while, at other times, it reclines
them even down; one time it resembles a bristly
sow, at another time a <i>sleekit cat</i>; and what
dead skin, except itself, could perform such cantrips?
Now, it happened one day, as this notable
fisher had returned from the prosecution of
his calling, that he was called upon by a man
who seemed a great stranger, and who said he
had been dispatched for him by a person who
wished to contract for a quantity of seal-skins,
and that it was necessary for the fisher to accompany
him (the stranger) immediately to see the
person who wished to contract for the skins, as
it was necessary that he should be served that
evening. Happy in the prospect of making a
good bargain, and never suspecting any duplicity
in the stranger, he instantly complied. They
both mounted a steed belonging to the stranger,
and took the road with such velocity that, although
the direction of the wind was towards
their back, yet the fleetness of their movement
made it appear as if it had been in their faces.
On reaching a stupendous precipice which overhung
the sea, his guide told him they had now
reached the point of their destination. “Where
is the person you spoke of?” inquired the astonished
seal-killer. “You shall see that presently,”
replied the guide. With that they immediately
alighted, and, without allowing the
seal-killer much time to indulge the frightful
suspicions that began to pervade his mind, the
stranger seized him with irresistible force, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
plunged headlong with the seal-killer into the
sea. After sinking down—down—nobody knows
how far, they at length reached a door, which,
being open, led them into a range of apartments,
filled with inhabitants—not people, but seals,
who could nevertheless speak and feel like human
folk; and how much was the seal-killer surprised
to find that he himself had been unconsciously
transformed into the like image! If it were not
so, he would probably have died, from the want
of breath. The nature of the poor fisher’s
thoughts may be more easily conceived than described.
Looking on the nature of the quarters
into which he was landed, all hopes of escape
from them appeared wholly chimerical, whilst the
degree of comfort and length of life which the
barren scene promised him were far from being
flattering. The “Roane,” who all seemed in
very low spirits, appeared to feel for him, and
endeavoured to soothe the distress which he
evinced, by the amplest assurances of personal
safety. Involved in sad meditation on his evil
fate, he was quickly roused from his stupor, by
his guide’s producing a huge gully or joctaleg,
the object of which he supposed was to put an
end to all his earthly cares. Forlorn as was his
situation, however, he did not wish to be killed;
and, apprehending instant destruction, he fell
down, and earnestly implored for mercy. The
poor generous animals did not mean him any
harm, however much his former conduct deserved
it; and he was accordingly desired to
pacify himself, and cease his cries. “Did you
ever see that knife before?” says the stranger to
the fisher. The latter instantly recognising his
own knife, which he had that day stuck into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
seal, and with which it made its escape, acknowledged
it was formerly his own, for what would
be the use of denying it? “Well!” rejoins the
guide, “the apparent seal, which made away
with it, is my father, who lies dangerously ill
ever since, and no means could stay his fleeting
breath, without your aid. I have been obliged
to resort to the artifice I have practised to bring
you hither, and I trust that my filial duty to my
father will readily operate my excuse.” Having
said this, he led into another apartment the
trembling seal-killer, who expected every minute
a return of his own favour to the father; and
here he found the identical seal, with which he
had the encounter in the morning, suffering most
grievously from a tremendous cut in its hind-quarter.
The seal-killer was then desired, with
his hand, to cicatrize the wound; upon doing
which, it immediately healed, and the seal arose
from its bed in perfect health. Upon this, the
scene changed from mourning to rejoicing,—all
was mirth and glee. Very different, however,
were the feelings of the unfortunate seal-catcher,
expecting, no doubt, to be a seal for the remainder
of his life, until his late guide accosted him as
follows: “Now, sir, you are at liberty to return
to your wife and family, to whom I am
about to conduct you; but it is on this express
condition, to which you must bind yourself by
a solemn oath, viz., that you shall never maim
or kill a seal in all your lifetime hereafter.” To
this condition, hard as it was, he joyfully acceded;
and the oath being administered in all
due form, he bade his new acquaintance most
heartily and sincerely a long farewell. Taking
hold of his guide, they issued from the place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
and swam up—up—till they regained the surface
of the sea; and, landing at the said stupendous
pinnacle, they found their former riding steed
ready for a second canter. The guide breathed
upon the fisher, and they became like men.
They mounted their horse; and fleet as was their
course towards the precipice or pinnacle, their
return from it was doubly swift; and the honest
seal-killer was laid down at his own door-cheek,
where his guide made him such a present as
would have almost reconciled him to another
similar expedition, and such as rendered his loss
of profession, in so far as regarded the seals, a
far less intolerable hardship than he had at first
contemplated it.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br>

OF THE FAIRIES AS A COMMUNITY—THEIR POLITICAL PRINCIPLES
AND INGENIOUS HABITS.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the description the reader may have seen
of the fairy community in general, as drawn in
the works of the eminent writers of the day, he
may have been led to form very erroneous estimates
not only of the dress of the <i>Highland</i>
fairies, but also of their political economy and
government.</p>

<p>There are few who have not heard of the
illustrious and divine beauty of the Queen of the
Fairies, and the splendid and dazzling courts
with which her majesty is surrounded on all
occasions of intercourse with the inhabitants of
this world. It appears, however, from all that
the compiler can learn, that the empire of Queen
Mab, like that of the renowned Cæsar, never
was extended to the northern side of the Grampians,
for she is entirely unknown in those
countries. Indeed, it is believed that the Highland
fairies acknowledge no distinctions of this
sort. As there were originally none such
amongst them in Paradise, so they are not disposed
to create any on earth,—and a more complete
republic never was.</p>

<p>It is true, Satan, no doubt, exercises a sort of
impotent chieftainship over them as his once
rebellious confederates,—but, it is believed, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
laws and his edicts are as much despised by
them as those of the Great Mogul. In spite of
all his power and policy, like the Israelites of
old, each does what is right in his own eyes; and,
unless on a Halloweven, or such occasion of
state, they may submit to a pageant review
more from motives of vanity than of loyalty,
Auld Nick’s ancient sovereignty over the fairy
community in this land of freedom has fallen
into desuetude.</p>

<p>The fairies are a very ingenious people. As
may be expected from the nature of their origin
and descent, they are possessed of very superior
intellectual powers, which they know well enough
how to apply to useful purposes. Nor are they
so vain of their abilities as to scorn to direct
them to the prosecution of those more ignoble
employments, on which the politer part of mankind
commonly look down with contempt. Whether
this condescension, on the part of the fairy,
be more the result of choice or necessity, it is
hard for us to determine; but certain it is, that
few communities can boast of a more numerous
or more proficient body of artisans. We are
told, indeed, by some of those well acquainted
with their manners, that every individual fairy
combines all the necessary arts in his own person—that
he is his own weaver, his own tailor,
and his own shoemaker. Whether this is truly
the case public opinion is rather divided; but
all our informants concur in this conclusion—that
by far the greater number of them understand
well enough those several callings; and
the expertness they display in handling the shuttle,
the needle, and the awl, evidently demonstrate
their practical knowledge of these implements.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
In support of this conclusion, we have
the authority of a decent old man, whose veracity,
on subjects of this description, has never
been questioned in the district in which he lived,
who favoured the compiler with the following
narration:</p>

<p>“My great-grandfather, (peace to his manes!)
who was by profession a weaver, and, by the
bye, a very honest man, though I should not
say it, was waked one night from his midnight
sleep by a tremendous noise. On looking ‘<i>out
over</i>’ the bed, to see whence it proceeded, he
was not a little astonished to find the house full
of operative fairies, who, with the greatest familiarity,
had made free with his manufacturing
implements. Having provided themselves with
a large sack of wool,—from whence it came they
best knew,—they were actively employed in
converting it into cloth. While one teethed it,
another carded it; while another span it, another
wove it; while another dyed it, another pressed
it; while the united bustle of their several operations,
joined to the exclamations uttered by
each expressive of his avocation, created a clamour
truly intolerable to the gudeman of the
house, with whom they used so unacceptable a
freedom. So diligent were they, that long ere
day they decamped with a web of green cloth,
consisting of fifty ells and more, without even
thanking my venerable grandfather for the use
of his machinery.”</p>

<p>Another narrative, with which we were favoured,
related the activity of a fairy shoemaker,
who sewed a pair of shoes for a “<i>mountain shepherd</i>”
during the time the latter mealed a bicker
of pottage for them. And another narrative related<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the expertness of a fairy <i>barber</i>, who shaved
an acquaintance so effectually with no sharper
a razor than the palm of his hand, that he never
afterwards required to undergo the same operation.
These, and a number of equally creditable
stories, confirm their transcendent superiority
as artisans over any other class of people
in Christendom.</p>

<p>Nor in the more honourable and learned professions
are they less dexterous. As architects
they stand quite unrivalled. To prove their
excellence in this art we have only to consider
the durability of their habitations. Some of
these, it is said, have outlived the ravages of
time and vicissitudes of weather for some thousand
years, without sustaining any other injury
than the suffocation of the smoke-vents—defects
which could no doubt be repaired with little
trouble. But as the relics of former ages receive
additional interest from their rude and ruinous
appearance, so must these monuments of fairy
genius excite in the breasts of the community
the most profound sentiments of respect and
veneration.</p>

<p>Nor are these the only monuments remaining
calculated to perpetuate their excellence as architects
and engineers,—there are others of too
lasting and extraordinary a character to escape
the notice of the traditional historian. We
allude to those stupendous superstructures built
by the fairies under the auspices of that distinguished
arch-architect Mr. Michael Scott, which
sufficiently demonstrate the skill of the designer
and the ability of the workmen. As the history
of this celebrated character (rendered not the
less interesting by the notices of him written by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
the Minstrel of Minstrels) is not yet quite complete,
we shall make no apology for submitting
to the reader the following anecdotes of his life,
which we have collected in the course of our
peregrinations.</p>

<h4>MICHAEL SCOTT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the early part of Michael Scott’s life he
was in the habit, as is not yet uncommon with
northern tradesmen, of emigrating annually to
the Scottish metropolis, for the purpose of being
employed in his capacity of mason. One time,
as himself and two companions were journeying
to the place of their destination for a similar
object, they had occasion to pass over a high
hill, the name of which is not mentioned, but
supposed to be one of the Grampians, and being
fatigued with climbing, they sat down to rest
themselves. They had no sooner done so than
they were warned to take to their heels by the
hissing of a large serpent, which they observed
revolving itself towards them with great velocity.
Terrified at the sight, Michael’s two companions
fled, while he, on the contrary, resolved to encounter
the serpent. The appalling monster
approached Michael Scott with distended mouth
and forked tongue; and, throwing itself into a
coil at his feet, was raising its head to inflict a
mortal sting, when Michael, with one stroke of
his stick, severed its body into three pieces.
Having rejoined his affrighted comrades, they
resumed their journey; and, on arriving at the
next public-house, it being late, and the travellers
being weary, they took up their quarters at
it for the night. In the course of the night’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
conversation, recurrence was naturally had to
Michael’s recent exploit with the serpent, when
the landlady of the house, who was remarkable
for her “arts,” happened to be present. Her
curiosity appeared much excited by the conversation;
and, after making some inquiries regarding
the colour of the serpent, which she was told
was <i>white</i>, she offered any of them, that would
procure her the middle piece, such a tempting
reward, as induced one of the party instantly to
go for it. The distance was not very great;
and, on reaching the spot, he found the middle
and tail piece in the place where Michael left
them; but the head piece was gone, it is supposed,
to a contiguous stream, to which the serpent is
said always to resort, after an encounter with the
human race, and, on immersing itself into the
water, “like polypus asunder cut,” it again
regenerates and recovers. On the other hand,
it is a circumstance deserving the attention of
the medical world, that should an individual,
unfortunate enough to be bitten by this galling
enemy of mankind, reach the water before the
serpent, his recovery from the effects of the
calamity is equally indubitable.</p>

<p>The landlady, on receiving the piece, which
still vibrated with life, seemed highly gratified
at her acquisition; and, over and above the promised
reward, regaled her lodgers very plentifully
with the choicest dainties in her house.
Fired with curiosity to know the purpose for
which the serpent was intended, the wily Michael
Scott was immediately seized with a severe fit of
indisposition,—an excruciating colic, the pains
of which could only be alleviated by continual
exposure to the fire, the warmth of which, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
affirmed, was in the highest degree beneficial
to him.</p>

<p>Never suspecting Michael Scott’s hypocrisy,
and naturally supposing that a person so severely
indisposed should feel very little curiosity about
the contents of any cooking utensils which might
lie around the fire, the landlady consented to
his desire of being allowed to recline all night
along the fireside. As soon as the other inmates
of the house were retired to bed, the landlady
resorted to her darling occupation; and, in this
feigned state of indisposition, Michael had a
favourable opportunity of watching most scrupulously
all her actions, through the key-hole of
a door leading to the next apartment where she
was. He could see the rites and ceremonies
with which the serpent was put into an oven,
along with many mysterious ingredients. After
which, the unsuspicious landlady placed it by
the fireside, where lay our distressed traveller,
to stove till the morning.</p>

<p>Once or twice, in the course of the night, the
“wife of the change-house,” under pretence of
inquiring for her sick lodger, and administering
to him some renovating cordials, the beneficial
effects of which he gratefully acknowledged,
took occasion to dip her finger in her saucepan,
upon which the cock, perched on his roost,
crowed aloud. All Michael’s sickness could not
prevent him from considering very inquisitively
the landlady’s cantrips, and particularly the influence
of the sauce upon the crowing of the
cock. Nor could he dissipate some inward
desires he felt to follow her example. At the
same time that he suspected that Satan had a
hand in the pye, yet he liked very much to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
at the bottom of the concern; and thus his reason
and his curiosity clashed against each other
for the space of several hours. At length, passion,
as is too often the case, became the conqueror.
Michael, too, dipt his finger in the
sauce, and applied it to the tip of his tongue, and
immediately the cock perched on the <i>spardan</i>
announced the circumstance in a mournful clarion.
Instantly his mind received a new light to which
he was formerly a stranger, and the astonished
dupe of a landlady now found it her interest to
admit her sagacious lodger into a knowledge of
the remainder of her secrets.</p>

<p>Endowed with the knowledge of “<i>good and
evil</i>,” and all the “<i>second sights</i>” that can be
acquired, Michael left his lodgings in the morning,
with the philosopher’s stone in his pocket.
By daily perfecting his supernatural attainments,
by new series of discoveries, he was more than a
match for Satan himself. Having seduced some
thousands of Satan’s best workmen into his employment,
he trained them up so successfully to
the architective business, and inspired them with
such industrious habits, that he was more than
sufficient for the architectural work of the empire.
To establish this assertion, we need only
refer to some remains of his workmanship still
existing north of the Grampians, some of them
stupendous bridges built by him in one short
night, with no other visible agents than two or
three workmen.</p>

<p>As the following anecdote is so applicable to
our purpose, we shall submit it to the reader as
a specimen of the expertness of Mr. Scott and
his agents.</p>

<p>On one occasion, work was getting scarce, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
might have been naturally expected, and his
workmen, as they were wont, flocked to his
doors, perpetually exclaiming, Work! work!
work! Continually annoyed by their incessant
entreaties, he called out to them in derision to
go and make a dry road from Fortrose to Arderseir
over the Moray Firth. Immediately their
cry ceased, and as Mr. Scott supposed it wholly
impracticable for them to execute his order, he
retired to rest, laughing most heartily at the chimerical
sort of employment he had given to his
industrious workmen. Early in the morning,
however, he got up and took a walk down at the
break of day to the shore, to divert himself at
the fruitless labours of his zealous workmen.
But on reaching the spot, what was his astonishment
to find the formidable piece of work allotted
to them only a few hours before almost quite
finished. Seeing the great damage the commercial
class of the community would sustain
from the operation, he ordered them to demolish
the most part of their work; leaving, however,
the point of Fortrose to show the traveller to
this day the wonderful exploit of Michael Scott’s
fairies.</p>

<p>On being thus again thrown out of employment,
their former clamour was resumed, nor
could Michael Scott, with all his sagacity, devise
a plan to keep them in innocent employment.
He at length discovered one. “Go,” says he,
“and manufacture me ropes that will carry me
to the back of the moon, of those materials,
<i>miller’s-sudds</i> and sea-sand.” Michael Scott
here obtained rest from his active operators; for,
when other work failed them, he always dispatched
them to their rope-manufactory. “But,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
says our relator, “though these agents could
never make proper ropes of those materials,
their efforts to that effect are far from being contemptible,—for
some of their ropes are seen by
the seaside till this blessed day.”</p>

<p>We shall close our notice of Michael Scott by
reciting one anecdote of him in the latter end
of his life, which, on that account, will not be
the less interesting.</p>

<p>In consequence of a violent quarrel which
Michael Scott once had with a person whom he
conceived to have caused him some injury,
Michael resolved, as the highest punishment he
could inflict upon him, to send his adversary to
that evil place designed only for Satan and his
black companions. He, accordingly, by means
of his supernatural machinations, sent the poor
unfortunate man thither; and had he been sent
by any other means than those of Michael Scott,
he would no doubt have met with a warm reception.
Out of pure spite to Michael, however,
when Satan learned who was his billet-master,
he would no more receive him than he would
receive the Wife of Beth; and, instead of treating
the unfortunate man with that harshness
characteristic of him, he showed him considerable
civilities. Introducing him to his “<i>Ben Taigh</i>,”
he directed her to show the stranger any curiosities
he might wish to see, hinting very significantly
that he had provided some accommodations
for their mutual friend Michael Scott, the
sight of which might afford him some gratification.
The polite housekeeper, accordingly,
conducted the stranger through the principal
apartments in the house, where he saw sights
which, it is hoped, the reader will never witness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
But the bed of Michael Scott!—his greatest
enemy could not but feel satiate with revenge
at the sight of it. It was a place too horrid to
be described, filled promiscuously with all the
horrid brutes imaginable. Toads and lions,
lizards and leeches, and, amongst the rest, not
the least conspicuous, a large serpent gaping for
Michael Scott, with its mouth wide open. This
last sight having satisfied the stranger’s curiosity,
he was led to the outer gate, and came off with
far more agreeable reflections than when he
entered.</p>

<p>He reached his friends, and, among other
pieces of news touching his travels, he was not
backward in relating the entertainment that
awaited his friend Michael Scott, as soon as he
would <i>stretch his foot</i> for the other world. But
Michael did not at all appear disconcerted at his
friend’s intelligence. He affirmed that he would
disappoint the d—l and him both in their expectations.
In proof of which, he gave the following
signs: “When I am just dead,” says he,
“open my breast, and extract my heart. Carry
it to some place where the public may see the
result. You will then transfix it upon a long
pole, and if Satan will have my soul, he will
come in the likeness of a black raven, and carry
it off; and if my soul will be saved, it will be
carried off by a white dove.” His friends faithfully
obeyed his instructions. Having exhibited
his heart in the manner directed, a large black
raven was observed to come from the east with
great fleetness; while a white dove came from
the west with equal velocity. The raven made
a furious dash at the heart, missing which, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
was unable to curb its force, till it was considerably
past it; and the dove, reaching the spot at
the same time, carried off the heart amidst the
cheers and ejaculations of the spectators.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br>

OF THEIR DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND FESTIVE HABITS.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is well known that the fairies are a sociable
people, passionately given to festive amusements
and jocund hilarity. Hence, it seldom happens
that they cohabit in pairs, like most other species,
but rove about in bands, each band having
a stated habitation or residence, to which they
resort as occasion suggests.</p>

<p>Their habitations are generally found in rough
irregular precipices and broken caverns, remarkable
for wildness of scenery, from whence we
may infer that they are particularly fond of what
we term the Romantic. These habitations are
composed of stones, in the form of irregular turrets,
of such size and shapes as the nature of the
materials and the taste of the architect happened
to suggest, and so solid in their structure as
frequently to resemble “masses of rocks or
earthen hillocks.”</p>

<p>Their doors, windows, smoke-vents, and other
conveniences, are so artfully constructed, as to
be invisible to the naked eye in day-light, though
in dark nights splendid lights are frequently
reflected through their invisible casements.</p>

<p>Within those “<i>Tomhans</i>,” or, as others term
them, “Shian,” sociality and mirth are ever the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
inmates,—and they are so much addicted to
dancing, that it forms their chief and favourite
amusement. The length of their reels will be
judged of from the following narrative:</p>

<p>“Once upon a time, a tenant in the neighbourhood
of Cairngorm in Strathspey emigrated
with his family and cattle to the forest of Glenavon,
which is well known to be inhabited by
many fairies as well as ghosts. Two of his sons
having been one night late out in search of some
of their sheep which had strayed, they had occasion
to pass a fairy turret, or dwelling, of very
large dimensions; and what was their astonishment
on observing streams of the most refulgent
light shining forth through innumerable crevices
in the rock—crevices which the sharpest eye in
the country had never seen before. Curiosity
led them towards the turret, when they were
charmed by the most exquisite sounds ever
emitted by a fiddle-string, which, joined to the
sportive mirth and glee accompanying it, reconciled
them in a great measure to the scene,
although they knew well enough the inhabitants
were fairies. Nay, overpowered by the enchanting
jigs played by the fiddler, one of the brothers
had even the hardihood to propose that
they should pay the occupants of the turret a
short visit. To this motion the other brother,
fond as he was of dancing, and animated as he
was by the music, would by no means consent,
and very earnestly inculcated upon his brother
many pithy arguments well calculated to restrain
his curiosity. But every new jig that was played,
and every new reel that was danced, inspired
the adventurous brother with additional ardour;
and at length, completely fascinated by the enchanting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
revelry, leaving all prudence behind,
at one leap he entered the ‘Shian.’ The poor
forlorn brother was now left in a most uncomfortable
situation. His grief for the loss of a
brother whom he dearly loved suggested to him
more than once the desperate idea of sharing his
fate, by following his example. But, on the
other hand, when he coolly considered the possibility
of sharing very different entertainment
from that which rung upon his ears, and remembering,
too, the comforts and conveniences of
his father’s fireside, the idea immediately appeared
to him any thing but prudent. After a
long and disagreeable altercation between his
affection for his brother and his regard for himself,
he came to the resolution of trying a middle
course;—that is, to send in at the window a few
remonstrances to his brother, which if he did
not attend to, let the consequences be upon his
own head. Accordingly, taking his station at
one of the crevices, and calling upon his brother,
three several times, by name, as use is, he sent
in to him, as aforesaid, the most moving pieces
of elocution he could think upon,—imploring
him, as he valued his poor parent’s life and blessing,
to come forth and go home with him,
Donald Macgillivray, his thrice affectionate and
unhappy brother. But, whether it was he could
not hear this eloquent harangue, or, what is more
probable, that he did not choose to attend to it,
certain it is, that it proved totally ineffectual
to accomplish its object,—and the consequence
was, that Donald Macgillivray found it equally
much his duty and his interest to return home
to his family with the melancholy tale of poor
Rory’s fate. All the prescribed ceremonies calculated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
to rescue him from the fairy dominion
were resorted to by his mourning relatives without
effect, and Rory was supposed as lost for
ever, when a <i>wise man</i> of the day having learned
the circumstance, set them upon a plan of having
him delivered at the end of twelve months from
his entry. ‘Return,’ says the <i>Duin Glichd</i> to
Donald, ‘to the place where you lost your brother,
a year and a day from the time. You will
insert in your garment a Rowan Cross, which
will protect you from the fairies’ interposition.
Enter the turret boldly and resolutely, in the
name of the Highest claim your brother, and,
if he does not accompany you voluntarily, seize
him and carry him off by force,—none dare interfere
with you.’”</p>

<p>The experiment appeared to the cautious contemplative
brother as one that was fraught with
no ordinary danger, and he would have most
willingly declined the prominent character allotted
to him in the performance of it, but for the importunate
entreaty of his friends, who implored
him, as he valued their blessing, not to slight
such excellent advice. Their entreaties, together
with his confidence in the virtues of the
Rowan Cross, overcame his scruples, and he, at
length, agreed to put the experiment in practice,
whatever the result might be.</p>

<p>Well then, the important day arrived, when
the father of those two sons was destined either
to recover his lost son, or to lose the only son
he had, and, anxious as the father felt, Donald
Macgillivray, the intended adventurer, felt no
less on the occasion. The hour of midnight
approached, when the drama was to be acted,
and Donald Macgillivray, loaded with all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
charms and benedictions in his country, took
mournful leave of his friends, and proceeded to
the scene of his intended enterprise. On approaching
the well-known turret, a repetition of
that mirth and those ravishing sounds, that had
been the source of so much sorrow to himself
and family, once more attracted his attention,
without at all creating in his mind any extraordinary
feelings of satisfaction. On the contrary,
he abhorred the sounds most heartily, and
felt much greater inclination to recede than to
advance. But what was to be done? courage,
character, and every thing dear to him, were at
stake—so that to advance was his only alternative.
In short, he reached the “<i>Shian</i>,” and
after twenty fruitless attempts, he at length
entered the place with trembling footsteps, and,
amidst the brilliant and jovial scene, the not
least gratifying spectacle which presented itself
to Donald was his brother Rory earnestly engaged
at the Highland Fling on the floor, at which, as
might have been expected, he had greatly improved.
Without losing much time in satisfying
his curiosity, by examining the quality of
the company, he ran to his brother, repeating,
most vehemently, the words prescribed to him
by the “<i>Wise man</i>”—seized him by the collar,
and insisted he should immediately accompany
him home to his poor afflicted parents. Rory
assented, provided he would allow him to finish
his single reel, assuring Donald, very earnestly,
that he had not been half an hour in the house.
In vain did the latter assure the former, that,
instead of half an hour, he had actually remained
twelve months. Nor would he have believed his
overjoyed friends on reaching home, “did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the calves, now grown into stots, and the newborn
babes, now travelling the house, at length
convince him, that in his single reel he had
danced for a twelvemonth and a day.”</p>

<p>This reel, however, in which Rory Macgillivray
had been engaged, although it may be considered
of pretty moderate length, will form but
a short space in a night’s entertainment, of which
the following is a brief account:</p>

<p>“Nearly three hundred years ago, there lived
in Strathspey two men, greatly celebrated for
their performances on the fiddle. It happened
upon a certain Christmas time that they had
formed the resolution of going to Inverness, to
be employed in their musical capacities during
that festive season. Accordingly, having arrived
in that great town, and secured lodgings, they
sent round the newsman and his bell, to announce
to the inhabitants their arrival in town,
and the object of it, their great celebrity in their
own country, the number of tunes they played,
and their rate of charge per day, per night, or
hour. Very soon after, they were called upon
by a venerable-looking old man, grey-haired and
somewhat wrinkled, of genteel deportment and
liberal disposition; for, instead of grudging their
charges, as they expected, he only said that he
would double the demand. They cheerfully
agreed to accompany him, and soon they found
themselves at the door of a very curious dwelling,
the appearance of which they did not at all
relish. It was night, but still they could easily
distinguish the house to be neither like the great
Castle Grant, Castle Lethindry, Castle Roy, or
Castle-na-muchkeruch at home, nor like any
other house they had seen on their travels. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
resembled a huge fairy ‘Tomhan,’ such as are
seen in Glenmore. But the mild persuasive
eloquence of the guide, reinforced by the irresistible
arguments of a purse of gold, soon
removed any scruples they felt at the idea of
entering so novel a mansion. They entered the
place, and all sensations of fear were soon absorbed
in those of admiration of the august
assembly which surrounded them; strings tuned
to sweet harmony soon gave birth to glee in the
dwelling. The floor bounded beneath the agile
‘<i>fantastic toe</i>,’ and gaiety in its height pervaded
every soul present. The night passed on harmoniously,
while the diversity of the reels and
the loveliness of the dancers presented to the
fiddlers the most gratifying scene they ever witnessed;
and in the morning, when the ball was
terminated, they took their leave, sorry that the
time of their engagement was so short, and
highly gratified at the liberal treatment which
they experienced. But what was their astonishment,
on issuing forth from this strange dwelling,
when they beheld the novel scene which surrounded
them. Instead of coming out of a
castle, they found they had come out of a little
hill, they knew not what way; and on entering
the town they found those objects which yesterday
shone in all the splendour of novelty, to-day
exhibit only the ruins and ravages of time, while
the strange innovations of dress and manners
displayed by their numerous spectators filled
them with wonder and consternation. At last
a mutual understanding took place between
themselves and the crowd assembled to look
upon them, and a short account of their adventures
led the more sagacious part of the spectators<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
to suspect at once that they had been paying
a visit to the inhabitants of <i>Tomnafurich</i>,
which, not long ago, was the grand rendezvous
of many of the fairy bands inhabiting the surrounding
districts; and the arrival of a very old
man on the spot set the matter fairly at rest.
On being attracted by the crowd, he walked up
to the two poor old oddities, who were the subject
of amazement, and having learned their history,
thus addressed them: ‘You are the two
men my great-grandfather lodged, and who, it
was supposed, were decoyed by Thomas Rymer
to Tomnafurich. Sore did your friends lament
your loss—but the lapse of a hundred years has
now rendered your name extinct.’</p>

<p>“Finding every circumstance conspire to
verify the old man’s story, the poor fiddlers were
naturally inspired with feelings of reverential
awe at the secret wonders of the Deity—and it
being the Sabbath-day, they naturally wished to
indulge those feelings in a place of worship.
They, accordingly, proceeded to church, and
took their places, to hear public worship, and
sat for a while listening to the pealing bells,
which, while they summoned the remainder of
the congregation to church, summoned them to
their long homes. When the ambassador of
peace ascended the sacred place, to announce to
his flock the glad tidings of the Gospel—strange
to tell, at the first word uttered by his lips, his
ancient hearers, the poor deluded fiddlers, both
crumbled into dust.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br>

OF THE PASSIONS AND PROPENSITIES OF THE FAIRIES.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ingenious reader must not suppose that,
because the fairies were once angelic, they have
continued so in this corrupt world to the present
day. They will be found to exhibit in their
conduct as signal proofs of degeneracy from
their original innocence and worth as their
mortal contemporary, man; and, as may be concluded,
this degeneracy has entailed upon them
those passions and infirmities, from which they
were, no doubt, once on a time exempt.</p>

<p>The fairies are remarkable for the amorousness
of their dispositions, and are not very backward
in forming attachments and connections
with the people that cannot with propriety be
called their own species. We are told it is an
undeniable fact, that it was once a common
practice with both sexes of the fairy people to
form intimacies with human swains and damsels,
whom they would visit at times and in places
highly unbecoming and suspicious; and these
improper intimacies not unfrequently produced,
as may be well believed, <i>their natural consequences</i>.
It exposed the fairy-females to that
indisposition to which, before their fall, they
were no doubt strangers—we mean the pains of
child-birth, which, it seems, they suffer in common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
with their earthly neighbours. To the
more sceptical part of our readers, the idea of
fairy fruition may appear somewhat incredible.
In order, however, to remove any doubt on the
subject, we submit the particulars of a fairy
accouchement, which took place, no doubt, “a
considerable time ago,” in the wilds of Cairngorm:</p>

<p>“A considerable time ago there was a woman
living in the neighbourhood of Cairngorm in
Strathspey, by profession a midwife, of extensive
practice, and esteemed, indeed, the best midwife
in the district. One night, while she was preparing
for bed, there came a loud knocking to
her door, indicating great haste in the person
that knocked. The midwife was accustomed to
such late intrusions, and concluded, even before
she opened the door, that her presence was too
much required at a <i>sick-bed</i>. She found the
person that knocked to be a rider and his horse,
<i>both out of breath</i>, and most impatient for her
company. The rider entreated the midwife to
make haste, and jump up behind him without
a single moment’s delay, else that the life of an
amiable woman was lost for ever. But the midwife,
having a great regard to cleanliness and
decorum, requested leave to exchange her apparel
before she set out; a motion which, on the
part of the rider, was met with a decided negative,
and nothing would satisfy the rider but that
the midwife would immediately jump up behind
him on his grey horse. His importunities were
irresistible, the midwife mounted, and off they
flew at full gallop. The midwife being now
seated, and fleeing on the road, she began naturally
to question her guide what he was—where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
he was going—and how far. He, however,
declined immediately making any other
reply to her questions than merely saying that
she would be well rewarded, which, however
consoling, was far from being satisfactory information
to the midwife. At length the course
they pursued, and the road they took, alarmed
the midwife beyond measure, and her guide
found it necessary to appease her fears by explaining
the matter, otherwise she would, in all
probability, prove inadequate to the discharge
of her duty. ‘My good woman,’ says the fairy
to the midwife, ‘be not alarmed; though I am
conducting you to a fairy habitation to assist a
fairy lady in distress, be not dismayed, I beseech
you; for I promise you, by all that is sacred, you
shall sustain no injury, but will be safely restored
to your dwelling when your business is effected,
with such boon or present as you shall choose
to ask or accept of.’ The fairy was a sweet
good-looking young fellow, and the candour of
his speech and the mildness of his demeanour
soothed her fears, and reconciled the <i>Ben Ghlun</i>,
in a great measure, to the enterprise. They
were not long in reaching the place, when the
midwife found the fairy lady in any thing but
easy circumstances, and soon proved the auspicious
instrument of bringing to the world a fine
lusty boy. All was joy and rejoicing in consequence,
and all the fairies in the turret flattered
and caressed the midwife. She was desired to
choose any gift in the power of fairies to grant,
which was instantly to be given her. Upon
which she asked, as a boon, that whomsoever
she or her posterity should attend in her professional
capacity, a safe and speedy delivery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
should be insured them. The favour was instantly
conferred on her, and all know to this
day that <i>Muruch-na-Ban</i>, the man-midwife,
possesses, in no inconsiderable degree, the professional
talents of his great-grandmother.”</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter, we owe it, in
justice to both the human and fairy communities
of the present day, to say, that such intercourse
as that described to have taken place betwixt
them is now extremely rare; and, with the
single exception of a good old shoemaker, now
or lately living in the village of Tomantoul,
who confesses having had some dalliances with
a “<i>lanan shi</i>” in his younger days, we do not
know personally any one who has carried matters
this length.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br>

OF THE FAIRY’S EMBEZZLING AND CRIMINAL PROPENSITIES.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, although the correspondence now subsisting
between the human and fairy people is
much more chaste and innocent than it was of
old, still it appears that the strong predilection
which the fairies entertained for human society
is far from being yet extinguished. It is no
doubt the existence of this predilection on the
part of the former, and the increasing shyness
on the part of the latter, that could induce the
fairies to resort to those dishonest methods to
which they now recur, to have their passion for
human society gratified.</p>

<p>We presume the reader is aware that the
fairies are much addicted to that heinous crime
child-stealing—a crime which these people, in
consequence, no doubt, of their long experience
in the practice, commit with wonderful
address. Often have they robbed the inexperienced
mother of her tender babe in the
height of day, while his place is taken by an
impudent impostor, whose sham sickness and
death entail on the unhappy parent an additional
load of misery. To warn unsuspicious mothers
of the dangers to which themselves and their
offspring are exposed from fairy practices, the
following narrative may be of use:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“There were once two natives of Strathspey
who were in the habit of dealing a little in the
whisky way—that is to say, they were accustomed
occasionally to visit a family in Glenlivat,
from whom they would buy a few barrels, which
they would again dispose of among the gentlemen
of Badenoch and Fort-William, to pretty
good account; and on those occasions, for reasons
well known to every district gauger, (an
evil death to him!) the Strathspeymen always
found it most convenient to travel by night.
Well, then, on one of those occasions, as they
were busy measuring the whisky in the friend’s
house at Glenlivat, a little child belonging to
the goodman, and which lay in the cradle, uttered
a piteous cry, as if it had been shot. The
goodwife, according to custom, blessed her child,
and, as she supposed, raised it from the cradle.
Ascribing the cry merely to infantine frailty or
fretfulness, the Strathspeymen took no particular
notice of it, and having their business
transacted, they proceeded on their way with
their cargo. A short distance from their friend’s
house, they were not a little astonished to find
a little child abandoned on the high road, without
a being in sight of it. One of the lads took
it up in his arms, on which it ceased its plaintive
cries, and with great fondness clasped his little
hands round his neck, and smiled. This naturally
excited some curiosity, and on closer examination
they clearly recognised it to be their
friend’s child. Suspicion was instantly attached
to the fairies, and this suspicion was a great deal
strengthened by the circumstance of the cry
uttered by the child, as already mentioned. Indeed,
they came to an immediate conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
that the fairies, having embezzled the real child,
then in their possession, and deposited a stock
or substitute in its place, it was the lucky presence
of mind discovered by its mother in blessing
it, on its having uttered the cry, that rescued
it from fairy dominion, for no sooner was the
blessing pronounced than they were compelled
to abandon the child. As their time was limited,
they could not with convenience immediately
return to their friend’s house to solve the mysterious
occurrence, but proceeded on their
journey, taking special care of their little
foundling.</p>

<p>“In about a fortnight thereafter, having occasion
for a few barrels more, they returned to
Glenlivat, taking the child along with them,
which, however, they concealed on arriving at
the father’s house. In the course of mutual
inquiries for each other’s welfare, the goodwife
took occasion to lament very bitterly a severe
and protracted illness which seized her child on
the night of their preceding visit, the nature of
which illness could not be ascertained, but, at all
events, certain death was the consequence to
the child. During this lamentation, the impostor
uttered the most piteous cries, and appeared in
the last stage of his sufferings; upon this, the
lads, without any preliminary remarks, produced
their little charge, telling the mother to take
courage, that they now presented her with her
real child, as healthy and thriving as a trout,
and that the object of her great solicitude was
nothing more than a barefaced fairy impostor.
A short statement of facts induced the happy
mother to agree to an exchange, she receiving
back her child, and the lads the stock or impostor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
to whom his new proprietors proceeded
to administer a warm specific commonly given
to his kin on similar occasions. They procured
an old creel and a bunch of straw, in order to
try the effects the burning element would have
in curing him of his grievous complaints. But
at the appearance of those articles, the stock
took the hint, and not choosing to wait a trial
of its effects, flew out at the smoke-hole, telling
the exulting spectators, on attaining the top of
the ‘<i>Lum</i>,’ that, had it not been for the unfortunate
arrival of the two travellers, he should
have given the inmates very different entertainment.”</p>

<p>When we reflect upon the extreme covetousness
manifested by the fairies for human children,
the frequent instances of their embezzlement,
and, on the other hand, the ease and simplicity
by which these robberies can be foiled, we feel
persuaded neither mother nor nurse will now
neglect the safeguards prescribed for the preservation
of children from such practices. It
is universally allowed by people conversant in
those important matters, that suspending the
child’s head downwards, on its being dressed in
the morning, is an excellent preservative from
every species of supernatural agency, and this is
certainly a cheap and simple process. A red
thread tied about its neck, or a rowan cross, are
said to be equally efficacious in preventing the
influence of evil spirits, evil eyes, and other
calamities of the same description.</p>

<p>But as it is natural to suppose that those precautions
will still be sometimes neglected, as
they have always too often been, it is fortunate
that a remedy has been discovered for those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
desperate cases, where repentance for past imprudence
would not avail. When a child has
actually been stolen, and a stock or substitute
left in its stead, the child may be recovered in
the following manner:—Let the stock be carried
to the junction of three shires, or the confluence
of three rivers, where it is to be left for the
night; and it is a certain fact, that if the child
has been stolen by the fairies, they must, in the
course of the night, return the genuine offspring,
and take away the spurious one.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>But children are not the only objects of their
envy. They are equally covetous of pregnant
females at a certain juncture, when they embrace
every opportunity of securing them, well knowing
that, by such acquisitions, they obtain a
double bargain. The process of stealing women
is the same as that of stealing children, only
their ranges in quest of such prizes are much
more extensive, as the following story will show:</p>

<p>“There was once a courageous clever man,
of the name of John Roy, who lived in Glenbrown,
in the parish of Abernethy. One night,
as John Roy was out traversing the hills for his
cattle, he happened to fall in with a fairy banditti,
whose manner of travelling indicated that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
they carried along with them some booty. Recollecting
an old, and, it seems, a faithful saying,
that the fairies are obliged to exchange any
booty they may possess for any return, however
unequal in value, on being challenged to that
effect, John Roy took off his bonnet, and threw
it towards them, demanding a fair exchange in
the emphatic Gaelic phrase, <i>Sluis sho slumus
Sheen</i>.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> It was, no doubt, an unprofitable
barter for the fairies. They, however, it would
appear, had no other alternative but to comply
with John Roy’s demand; and in room of the
bonnet, they abandoned the burden, which
turned out to be nothing more nor less than a
fine fresh lady, who, from her dress and language,
appeared to be a <i>Sasonach</i>. With great humanity,
John Roy conducted the unfortunate
lady to his house, where she was treated with
the utmost tenderness for several years; and
the endearing attentions paid to her by John
and his family won so much her affections as
to render her soon happy in her lot. Her habits
became gradually assimilated to those of her
new society; and the Saxon lady was no longer
viewed in any other character than as a member
of John Roy’s family.</p>

<p>“It happened, however, in the course of
time, that the <i>new king</i> found it necessary to
make the great roads through those countries
by means of soldiers, for the purpose of letting
coaches and carriages pass to the northern cities;
and those soldiers had officers and commanders
in the same way as our fighting army have now.
Those soldiers were never great favourites in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
these countries, particularly during the time
that our own kings were alive; and, consequently,
it was no easy matter for them, either
officers or men, to procure for themselves comfortable
quarters. But John Roy forgot the
national animosity of his countrymen to the
<i>Cotton Darg</i> (red coat), when the latter appealed
to his generosity as an individual; and
he, accordingly, did not hesitate to offer an
asylum under his roof to a <i>Saxon</i> captain and
his son, who commanded a party employed in
his immediate neighbourhood. His offer was
thankfully accepted of, and while the strangers
were highly delighted at the cleanliness and
economy of the house and family of their host,
the latter was quite satisfied with the frankness
and urbanity of manners displayed by his guests.
One thing, however, caused some feelings of
uneasiness to John Roy, and that was the extreme
curiosity manifested by them, whenever
they were in the company or presence of his
English foundling, on whom their eyes were
continually rivetted, as if she were a ghost or a
fairy. On one occasion, it happened that the
captain’s son lapsed into a state of the profoundest
meditation, gazing upon this lady with
silent emotion. ‘My son,’ says the captain, his
father, ‘tell me what is the cause of your deep
meditation?’—‘Father,’ replies the sweet youth,
‘I think on the days that are gone; and of my
dearest mother, who is now no more. I have
been led into those reflections by the appearance
of that lady who is now before me. Oh, father!
does she not strikingly resemble the late partner
of your heart; she for whom you so often mourn
in secret?’—‘Indeed, my son,’ replied the father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
‘the resemblance has frequently recurred to
me too forcibly. Never were twin sisters more
like; and, were not the thing impossible, I
should even say she was my dearest departed
wife;’—pronouncing her name as he spoke, and
also the names of characters nearly connected
to both parties. Attracted by the mention of
her real name, which she had not heard repeated
for a number of years before, and attracted still
more by the nature of their conversation, the
lady, on strict examination of the appearance of
the strangers, instantly recognised her tender
husband and darling son. Natural instinct
could be no longer restrained. She threw herself
upon her husband’s bosom; and Ossian, the
son of Fingal, could not describe in adequate
terms the transports of joy that prevailed at the
meeting. Suffice it to say, that the <i>Saxon</i> lady
was again restored to her affectionate husband,
pure and unblemished as when he lost her, and
John Roy gratified by the only reward he would
accept of—the pleasure of doing good.”</p>

<p>From the sequel of the story, it appears that
some of the hordes of fairies, inhabiting the
“Shian of Coir-laggack,” found it convenient,
for purposes which may be easily guessed at, to
take a trip to the south of England, and made
no scruple to kidnap this lady in the absence of
her husband, and on the occasion of her accouchement.
A stock was, of course, deposited in her
stead—which, of <i>course</i>, died in a few days after—and
which, of <i>course</i>, was interred in the full
persuasion of <i>its</i> being the lady in question,
with all the splendour which her merits deserved.
Thus would the perfidious fairies have enjoyed
the fruits of their cunning, without even a suspicion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
of their knavery, were it not for the
“cleverness and generosity of John Roy, who
once lived in Glenbrown.”</p>

<p>The natural passions, lusts, and covetousness
of which we have now shown the fairies to be
possessed, are not, however, our only grounds
for calling in question the fitness of their title to
angelic nature and attributes. For it will be
seen, from some traits in their character about to
be detailed, that their appetites are as keen and
voluptuous as their inclinations are corrupt and
wicked. Our readers would be apt to believe,
from the first outline of their character, that
they were an amiable, harmless race of people,
strictly honest, and given entirely to innocent
amusements. But it is a fact too well known,
that many of them are employed in very different
avocations from mirth and dancing; for, to
repeat an old Scottish proverb, “if a’ tales be
true,” thieving and blackguarding occupy fully
as much of their time as mirth and dancing.
And what is still worse, it is much suspected
that their proneness to theft and knavery is not
so much the effect of necessity, as it is the effect
of wanton depravity. However base and degrading
in the eyes of society appears the thief, even
when his deviation from honesty is the result of
<i>sheer</i> necessity, he appears infinitely more so
when he is solely led to the commission of crimes
from wanton levity. Hence the indignation
which a worthy man feels, whenever those pilfering
depredators embezzle the fruits of his
honest industry. The <i>whirlwind</i> is not the alone
engine of robbery to which the fairies resort;
they recur to others of a more direct and ruinous
character; while the loser, from the speciousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
of their artifices, is seldom conscious of the true
cause of his loss. In order to expose the wantonness
of such pillage as they will be shown to be
guilty of, we need only call our reader’s attention
to the extent of the indisputable perquisites
which they derive from fire and other calamities
incident to the estate of man, many of which
calamities, we are told, are accomplished by their
agency. As, however, we would not readily
accuse them of crimes so atrocious, without
some foundation, we submit the following particulars
to the judgment of our readers, leaving
them to draw their own inferences.</p>

<p>“One day a fairy woman, residing in the
turrets of Craig-Aulnaic, called on one of the
tenants’ wives in Delnabo, in her neighbourhood,
and requested of her the loan of a firlot of
oatmeal for meat to her family, promising she
would return it in a very short time, as she herself
hourly expected a considerable supply. Not
choosing, for so small a trifle, to incur the fairy’s
displeasure, the tenant’s wife complied with her
request, from the same motives as if she had
been the exciseman. After regaling the fairy
with a dram and bread and cheese, as is the
custom of the country, she went out to give her
the customary convoy. On ascending the eminence
above the town, the ‘<i>Benshi</i>’ paused, and,
with apparent exultation, told the tenant’s wife
that she might take her meal home with her, as
she herself was now supplied as she expected.
The woman, without putting any impertinent
questions to the lady as to the source whence
her supply proceeded, cheerfully agreed to receive
back her meal, and took leave of her visitor.
She was not a little surprised, however, to observe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
in a few minutes thereafter, the corn-kiln
of an adjacent farm in total conflagration, with
all its contents.”</p>

<p>Over and above this, all liquids spilled on the
ground are supposed to go to their use; and
there are some people even so charitable as
purposely to reserve for their participation a
share of the best they possess. It is not unlikely
that such generous actions were in some
degree influenced by such returns as the following:—</p>

<p>“Once upon a time, a farmer, in Strathspey,
was engaged sowing a field upon his farm, and,
as is not uncommon, he accompanied his labours
with a cheerful song. Now the fairies are very
fond of music, and not less so of spoil,—and
whether it was the music or the seed that
attracted her most to the spot, certain it is, that
a fairy damsel, of great beauty and elegance,
presented herself to the farmer. She requested
of him, as a particular favour, to sing her an old
Gaelic song, ‘<i>Nighan Donne na Bual</i>;’ and,
when this favour was granted her, she sought of
him a present of corn. Although he had far less
objections to her first request than he had to her
second, he did not flatly refuse her, but he did
what any prudent man would do in similar circumstances,—he
inquired what she would give
him in return. She answered, that, provided
he granted her request, his seed would not the
more speedily fail him; and this assurance she
enforced with a look so significant, as to induce
him at once to supply her very liberally from
his bag. She then departed, and he resumed
his work. He was soon after very agreeably
surprised, when he found that, after sowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
abundantly a large field, wont to take five times
the bulk of his bag, it appeared equal in size
and weight to what it was when he met with the
fairy nymph. Far from being in the least confounded
at the agreeable circumstance, he threw
his bag over his shoulder, highly satisfied at the
act of munificence he did in the morning, and
sowed with it another field of equal extent,
without its exhibiting any appearance of diminution.
Perfectly satisfied now with his day’s
labour, he returned home, fully determined to
take care of his bag. But, just as he was entering
the barn door, who met him but his wife, ‘who
was a foolish talkative hussey, having a tongue
as long, and a head as empty, as the parish
church bell.’ With her usual loquacity she
accosted him, expressing her astonishment at
the unaccountable nature of the sack, that had
thus sown half their farm,—expressing, moreover,
very notable suspicions of the cause. Now
it is well known that, whenever any supernatural
agency is challenged, the spell is instantly
broken. So that the clashmaclavering
Jezebel had scarcely uttered those inconsiderate
and highly reprehensible words, when the burden
on the farmer’s back became an empty bag.
‘I’ll be your death, you foolish, foolish woman,’
exclaimed her woe-struck husband; ‘were it
not for your imprudent talk, this bag were worth
its weight of gold.’”</p>

<p>Such relations as the foregoing should go very
far to induce every prudent and foreseeing man
to be on as friendly a footing as possible with
those capricious and all-powerful people, especially
when their friendship is to be purchased
on such reasonable terms as those of which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
have just read. The unhappy hero of the following
narrative was convinced, when too late,
of the truth of this observation.</p>

<p>“A farmer, who at one time occupied the
farm of Auchriachan, of Strathavon, was one
day searching for his goats in a remote hill in
Glenlivat, and what came on but a thick hazy
fog, which marred his way, and bewildered his
senses. Every stone, magnified by the delusion
of the moment, appeared a mountain; every
rivulet seemed to him to run in an opposite
direction to its usual course; and the unhappy
traveller thought of his fireside, which he expected
never to see more. Night came on
apace; its horrific gloom, as it approached, dispelled
the unhappy wanderer’s forlorn hopes,
and he now sat down to prepare for the world
that has no end. Involved in perplexity at his
unhappy situation, he threw a mournful look on
the gloomy scene around him, as if to bid the
world an eternal adieu,—when, lo! a twinkling
light glimmered on his eye. It was a cheering
blink that administered comfort to his soul. His
frigid limbs, which lately refused their office,
recovered their vigour. His exhausted frame
became animated and energetic: and he immediately
directed his course towards the light,
which, from its reflection, seemed not far distant.
On reaching the place, however, his joy was a
good deal damped when he examined the nature
of the place whence the light reflected. A
human foot never seemed to have visited the
scene; it was one of wildness and horror. Life,
however, is exceedingly sweet when we are on
the brink of losing it, and necessity had so far
subdued every vestige of fear, that <i>Auchriachan</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
resolved at all hazards to take a night’s lodging
with the inmates, whatever their nature or calling
might be. The door was open, and he entered
the place. His courage, however, was a
good deal appalled, on meeting at the door an
old female acquaintance, whose funeral he had
recently attended, and who, it appeared, acted
in this family in the capacity of housewife. But
this meeting, however disagreeable it proved to
Auchriachan in one respect, ultimately turned
out a fortunate circumstance for him, inasmuch
as his old acquaintance was the happy means of
saving his life. On observing Auchriachan—for
that was the farmer’s title—enter the abode,
she instantly ran towards him, and told him he
was done for, unless he chose to slip in into a
bye-corner off the principal apartment, where
he had better remain until she found an opportunity
of effecting his escape. The advice of
the friendly housekeeper he thought it prudent
to adopt, and he was accordingly content to
hide himself in a crevice in the apartment.
Scarce had he done so, when there entered the
dwelling an immense concourse of fairies, who
had been all day absent upon some important
expedition; and being well appetized by their
journey, they all cried out for some food. Having
all sat in council, the question proposed for
discussion was, ‘What was their supper to consist
of?’—When an old sagacious looking fairy,
who sat in the chimney corner, spoke as follows:
‘Celestial gentlemen, you all know and abhor
that old miserly fellow the taxman of Auchriachan.
Mean and penurious, he appropriates
nothing to us; but, on the contrary, disappoints
us of our very dues. By learning too well the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
lesson taught him by his old and wizened grand-mother,
nothing escapes a blessing and a safeguard;
and the consequence is, that we cannot
interfere with the gleanings on his fields, far less
the stock and produce. Now, Auchriachan himself
is not at home this night; he is in search of
his goats, our allies,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>—his less careful household
have neglected the customary safeguards; and,
lo! his goods are at our mercy. Come, let us
have his favourite ox to supper.’—‘Bravo!’
exclaimed the whole assembly; ‘the opinion of
Thomas Rymer is always judicious; Auchriachan
is certainly a miserable devil, and we shall
have his favourite ox to supper.’—‘But whence
shall we procure bread to eat with him?’ inquired
a greedy-looking fairy. ‘We shall have the
new baken bread of Auchriachan,’ replied the
sagacious and sage counsellor, Mr. Rymer; ‘for
he is a miserly old fellow—he himself is not at
home, and his wife has forgot to cross the first
bannock.’—‘Bravo!’ exclaimed the whole assembly.
‘By all means, let us have the new baken
bread of Auchriachan.’</p>

<p>“Thus did Auchriachan, honest man, who,
indeed, was not at home, with no very grateful
feelings, learn the fate of his favourite ox, without,
however, dissenting from the general voice
that pronounced his doom. And, in pursuance
of the same unpleasant decision, he had the additional
mortification to see his ill-fated ox
deliberately introduced by the nose and killed
in his presence. Meantime, when all were engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
cooking the ox, the officious housekeeper
took occasion, under pretence of some other
errand, to relieve Auchriachan from his uncomfortable
seclusion. On issuing forth from Mr.
Rymer’s council-chamber, Auchriachan found
the mist had entirely disappeared—the stones
were now of their natural size—the rivulets now
ran their usual course—the moon threw her
silver mantle over the lately murky scene, and he
had now no difficulty to make his way home, lamenting
most sincerely the lot of his favourite ox.</p>

<p>“On arriving at home, he was cordially welcomed
by his happy family, whose great anxiety
for his safety was probably the cause of the omission
of that duty that poor Auchriachan had so
much cause to deplore. His overjoyed wife,
supposing her husband to be no doubt in a hungry
case, provided a basket of new baked bread
and milk, and urged him to eat, for sure he
might well be hungry. He did not, however,
mind her solicitude for his comfort—he was
sorry and sullen, and cared not for the provision,
particularly the bread, well knowing it was only
an abominable phantom. At last he inquired,
‘Which of you served the oxen this night, my
lads?’—‘It was I, my father,’ replied one of his
sons. ‘And did you mind the customary safeguard?’—‘Indeed,’
says the son, ‘from my
great agitation for the fate of my father, I
believe I forgot.’—‘Alas! alas!’ exclaimed the
affectionate farmer, ‘my dear and favourite ox
is no more!’—‘What!’ exclaims one of his sons,
‘I saw him alive not two hours ago!’—‘It was
only a fairy stock,’ says Auchriachan. ‘Bring
him out here until I dispatch him.’ The farmer
then, venting the most unqualified expressions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
of his indignation upon the stock and its knavish
proprietors, struck it such a pithy blow on the
forehead as felled it to the ground. Rolling down
the brae, at the back of the house, to the bottom,
there it lay and the bread along with it, both
unmolested; for it was a remarkable circumstance,
that neither dog nor cat ever put a tooth
on the carcase.”</p>

<p>It now only remains for us to describe the
most heinous of all their crimes, a crime which we
are peculiarly reluctant to bring so openly to
light, did not our impartiality as an historian
compel us. This crime consists in their destruction
of human beings, and their cattle, by means
of their magical dart, commonly called an elf-bolt.
Those bolts are of various sizes, of a hard
yellowish substance, resembling somewhat the
flint, for which they are no bad substitutes.
The bolt is very frequently of the shape of a
heart, its edges being indented like a saw, and
very sharp at the point. This deadly weapon
the wicked fairy will throw at man or beast with
such precision as seldom to miss his aim; and
whenever it hits, the stroke is fatal. Such is
the great force with which it is flung, that on
its striking the object it instantaneously perforates
it to the heart, and a sudden death is the
consequence. In the blinking of an eye, a man
or an ox is struck down cold-dead, and, strange
to say, the wound is not discernible to an ordinary
person, unless he is possessed of the charm
that enables some wise people to trace the course
of the bolt, and ultimately discover it in the
dead body.—Note, whenever this fatal instrument
is discovered, it should be carefully preserved,
as it defends its possessor from the fatal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
consequences of the “<i>Fay</i>,” so long as he retains
it about him.</p>

<p>Having now travelled over the leading traits
of the fairy’s character, publicly and privately,
we shall now conclude our treatise of him by
subjoining a few of the most approved cures and
safeguards, which afford protection from his
dangerous practices. An abler historian might
be disposed to offer some learned observations
on the strange incongruity of character exhibited
by the fairy in the preceding sketches, and
endeavour, if he could, to reconcile them so as
to form any thing like a rational subject. As a
plain unvarnished compiler, however, we have
discharged our duty; we have detailed, to the
best of our ability, the fairy’s character, according
to the nature of our materials; and if our
delineations are strange and inconsistent, the fault
lies either with the fairy or his professed historians,
and not with the mere machine, <i>ourself</i>,
the compiler.</p>

<p>Go to the summit of some stupendous cliff or
mountain, where any species of quadruped has
never fed nor trod, and gather of that herb in
the Gaelic language called “<i>Mohan</i>,” which can
be pointed out by any “<i>wise</i> person.” This
herb you will give to a cow, and of the milk of
that cow you are to make a cheese, and whoever
eats of that cheese is for ever after, as well as
his gear, perfectly secure from every species of
fairy agency.</p>

<p>A piece of torch fir carried about the person,
and a knife made of iron which has never been
applied to any purpose, are both excellent preservatives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>A piece of cold iron or steel put into the bed
of a lady “<i>uneasy in her circumstances</i>” will
protect mother and offspring from being
“<i>Fayed</i>.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">BROWNIES.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> this mysterious and very useful agent
has now become very rare among the Highland
mountains, it appears that, at one time, he was
the common appendage of every family of rank
in those countries. Hence, his history and
character are well known; and his memory still
retains a powerful interest in the minds of the
inhabitants. It may not, therefore, be improper
to give a condensed account of the most prominent
traits of the Highland Brownie’s character,
to enable the reader to compare his manners
and habits with those of the Brownie of Bodspeck,
or any other Brownie with the manners
of whom he may happen to be acquainted.</p>

<p>With regard to the Brownie’s origin, it is a
point that is involved in much obscurity. It
was always a peculiar trait in his character, that
he never would favour his earthly acquaintances
with any information regarding his own private
affairs. From some resemblance the Brownie
bore to the Fairy, joined to a similarity of habits,
it was shrewdly suspected by the more discriminating
sort of people, that if he were not actually
a member of the Fairy people, he was, at least,
a mongrel species of them. But on this important
topic the sagacious Brownie himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
opened not his mouth; leaving them to argue
the matter as they thought proper.</p>

<p>In his personal appearance, the Highland
Brownie was highly interesting. His person
was not quite so tall as that of the Fairy, but it
was well proportioned and comely; and, from
the peculiar brownness of his complexion, he
received the appellation of <i>Brownie</i>.</p>

<p>In his manners and habits he differed widely
from all the supernatural beings of his day;
inasmuch as he was laborious and faithful to
his master’s interest—content to labour day and
night for no other fee or reward than a scanty
diet, and occasionally a suit of cast-off apparel.
Hence, the possession of so cheap and useful an
agent was an acquisition highly desirable. But
he was what neither money nor interest could
procure. Having once united himself to the
founder of an ancient family, he adhered to him
and to his issue so long as he had any lineal
posterity; and hence it is, that the Brownie was
only found the heir-loom of an ancient and honourable
family.</p>

<p>Unexampled for his fidelity, he was the indefatigable
guardian and promoter of his adopted
master’s interest; and, from his powers of prophecy
and information, his services were truly
invaluable. Over the servants he was always a
vigilant and faithful spy, ready to give a faithful
account of their good or bad actions; and
hence it followed, that with these he was very
seldom on a good understanding. So that, if
the Brownie was left to the servants’ mercy, he
would not, in all likelihood, fare the better for
his fidelity. But if the master had any regard
to his own interest, he was careful to have seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
him properly cared for in his meat and in his
drink, which care was rewarded by the most
unlimited devotion to his interest.</p>

<p>The last two brownies known in this quarter
of the Highlands were long the appendages of
the ancient family of Tullochgorm in Strathspey.
They were male and female, and, for
aught we know, they might likewise have been
man and wife. The male was of an exceedingly
jocose and humorous disposition, often indulging
in little sports at the expense of his fellow-servants.
He had, in particular, a great trick
of flinging clods at the passengers, and from
thence he got the name of “<i>Brownie-Clod</i>.”
He had, however, with all his humour, a great
deal of simplicity about him, and became, in
his turn, the dupe of those on whom he affected
to play. An eminent instance of this appears
from a contract into which he foolishly entered
with the servants of Tullochgorm, whereby he
bound and obliged himself to thrash as much
corn and straw as two men could do for the
space of a whole winter, on condition he was to
be gratified with an old coat and a Kilmarnock
cowl, pieces of apparel for which, it seems, he
had a great liking. While the servants were
reclining themselves at their ease upon the straw,
poor Brownie-Clod thrashed on unremittingly,
and performed such Herculean tasks as no human
constitution could bear for a week together.
Some time before the expiry of the contract,
the lads, out of pure gratitude and pity, left
the coat and cowl for him on a mow of corn in
the barn, on receipt of which he instantly struck
work, and with the greatest triumph at the idea
of taking in his acquaintances, he sneeringly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
told them, that, since they were so foolish as

<p>The female was more pawky in her ways;
and, instead of being a laughing-stock to the
female-servants with whom she wrought, she
was a sort of a mistress over them. She was
seldom on good terms with them, in consequence
of the fidelity with which she reported their
neglect of duty to their master or mistress. It
was her custom to wear a superabundance of
hair, in consequence of which, she was commonly
called “<i>Maug Vuluchd</i>,” or “Hairy Mag.”
Mag was an honest and excellent housekeeper,
and had the service of the table generally assigned
her, in which capacity she was extremely
useful. The dexterity and care with which she
covered the table, always invisible, was not less
amusing to strangers than it was convenient to
their host. Whatever was called for came as
if it floated on the air, and lighted on the table
with the utmost ease and celerity; and, for
cleanliness and attention, she had not her equal
in this land.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">WATER-KELPIES.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the former and darker ages of the world
when people had not half the wit and sagacity
they now possess, and when, consequently, they
were much easier duped by such designing
agents, the “Ech Uisque,” or <i>Water-Horse</i>, as
the Kelpie is commonly called, was a well-known
character in those countries. The Kelpie
was an infernal agent, retained in the service
and pay of Satan, who granted him a commission
to execute such services as appeared profitable
to his interest. He was an amphibious
character, and generally took up his residence
in lochs and pools, bordering on public roads
and other situations, most convenient for his
professional calling.</p>

<p>His commission consisted in the destruction
of human beings, without affording them time
to prepare for their immortal interests, and thus
endeavour to send their souls to his master,
while he, the Kelpie, enjoyed the body. However,
he had no authority to touch a human
being of his own free accord, unless the latter
was the aggressor. In order, therefore, to delude
public travellers and others to their destruction,
it was the common practice of the
Kelpie to assume the most fascinating form, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
assimilate himself to that likeness which he
supposed most congenial to the inclinations of
his intended victim. The likeness of a fine
riding steed was his favourite disguise. Decked
out in the most splendid riding accoutrements,
the perfidious Kelpie would place himself in
the weary traveller’s way, and graze by the
road-side with all the seeming innocence and
simplicity in the world. The traveller, supposing
this fine horse to have strayed from his
master, and considering him as a good <i>catch</i> for
carrying him a part of the way, would approach
the horse with the greatest caution, soothing it
with <i>proogy proogy</i>, and many other terms of
endearment, in the event of his taking to his
heels, as wild horses are sometimes apt to do.
But this horse knew better what he was about;
he was as calm and peaceable as a lamb, until his
victim was once fairly mounted on his back;
with a fiend-like yell he would then announce
his triumph, and plunging headlong with his
woe-struck rider into an adjacent pool, enjoy
him for his repast. The following curious relation,
communicated to the compiler by the celebrated
Mr. Wellox, who possesses the precious
relic captured from the kelpie alluded to in the
story, will complete all the information that is
necessary regarding this once formidable entrapper
of mankind:</p>

<p>“In the time of my renowned ancestor, Mr.
James Macgrigor, (rest to his soul!) who was
well known to be a good man, and a man of
great strength and courage in his day, there was
a most mischievous water-kelpie that lived in
Lochness, and which committed the most atrocious
excesses on the defenceless inhabitants of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the surrounding districts. It was the common
practice of this iniquitous agent to prowl about
the public roads, decked out in all the trappings
of a riding horse, and in this disguise place himself
in the way of the passenger, who often took
it into his head to mount him, to his no small
prejudice; for upon this the vicious brute would
immediately fly into the air, and in a jiffy light
with his rider in Lochnadorb, Lochspynie, or
Lochness, where he would enjoy his victim at
his leisure. Filled with indignation at the repeated
relations he had heard of the kelpie’s
practices, my ancestor, Mr. Macgrigor, ardently
wished to fall in with his kelpieship, in order to
have a bit of a communing with him touching
his notorious practices. And Providence, in its
wise economy, thought it meet that Mr. Macgrigor
should be gratified in his wish.</p>

<p>“One day as he was travelling along ‘<i>Slochd
Muichd</i>,’ a wild and solitary pass on the road
between Strathspey and Inverness, whom did
he observe but this identical water-kelpie, browsing
away by the road-side with the greatest complacency,
thinking, no doubt, in his mind, that
he would kidnap Mr. Macgrigor as he had done
others. But in this idea he found himself wofully
mistaken! For no sooner did Mr. Macgrigor
espy him, than he instantly determined
to have a trial of his mettle. Accordingly,
marching up to the horse, who thought, no doubt,
he was just coming to mount him, Mr. Macgrigor
soon convinced him of the contrary by drawing
his trusty sword, with which he dealt the kelpie
such a pithy blow on the nose, as almost felled
him to the ground. The stroke maltreated the
kelpie’s jaw very considerably, cutting through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
his bridle, in consequence of which, one of the
bits, being that which you have just examined,
fell down on the ground. Observing the bit
lying at his feet, Mr. Macgrigor had the curiosity
to pick it up, whilst the astonished kelpie
was recovering from the effects of the blow, and
this bit Mr. Macgrigor carelessly threw into his
pocket. He then prepared for a renewal of his
conflict with its former owner, naturally supposing
the kelpie would return him his compliment.
But what was Mr. Macgrigor’s surprise,
when he found that, instead of retorting his
blow, and fighting out the matter to the last,
the kelpie commenced a cool dissertation upon
the injustice and illegality of Mr. Macgrigor’s
proceedings. ‘What is your business with me?’
says he. ‘What is your business with me, Mr.
Macgrigor? I have often heard of you as a man
of great honour and humanity; why, therefore,
thus abuse a poor defenceless animal like me,
let me be a horse, or let me be a kelpie, so long
as I did you no harm? In my humble opinion,
Mr. Macgrigor,’ continued the kelpie, ‘you acted
both cruelly and illegally; and certainly your
conduct would justify me, if I should return you
twofold your assault upon me. However, I
abominate quarrels of this sort,’ says the conciliatory
kelpie, ‘and if you peaceably return me
the bit of my bridle, we shall say no more on the
subject.’ To this learned argument of the kelpie
Mr. Macgrigor made no other reply than flatly
denying his request, in the first place; and, in
the second place, mentioning, in pretty unqualified
terms, his opinion of his character and profession.
‘It is true,’ replied the other, ‘that
I am what you call a kelpie; but it is known to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
my heart, that my profession was never quite
congenial to my feelings. We kelpies engage
in many <i>disagreeable undertakings</i>. But, as
the proverb says, Necessity has no law; and
there is no profession that a man or spirit
will not sometimes try, <i>for the sake of an
honest livelihood</i>: so you will please have the
goodness to give me the bit of my bridle.’ Observing
the great anxiety evinced by the kelpie
to have the bit of his bridle restored to him,
and feeling anxious to learn its properties, my
sagacious ancestor immediately concocted a plan,
whereby he might elicit from the poor dupe of
a kelpie an account of its virtues. ‘Well, Mr.
Kelpie,’ says Mr. Macgrigor, ‘all your logic
cannot change my opinion of the criminality of
your profession, though, I confess, it has somewhat
disarmed me of my personal hostility to
you as a member of it; I am, therefore, disposed
to deliver up to you the bit of your bridle, but
it is on this express condition, that you will
favour me with an account of its use and qualities,
for I am naturally very <i>curious</i>, do you know.’
To this proposition the kelpie joyfully acceded,
and thus addressed Mr. Macgrigor: ‘My dear
sir, you must know that such agents as I are
invested by our Royal Master with a particular
commission, consisting of some document delivered
to us by his own hand. The commission
delivered to a kelpie consists in a bridle invested
with all those powers of transformation,
information, and observation, necessary for our
calling; and wherever we lose this commission,
whether voluntarily or by accident, our power
is at an end, and certain annihilation within four
and twenty hours is the consequence. Had it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
not been that my bridle was broken by your
matchless blow, I must be so candid as to declare,
I might have broken every bone in your body;
but now you are stronger than myself, and you
can be half a kelpie at your pleasure: only
please to look through the holes of the bit of the
bridle, and you will see myriads of invisible
agents, fairies, witches, and devils, all flying
around you, the same as if you had been gifted
with the second-sight, and all their machinations
clearly exposed to your observation.’—‘My dear
sir,’ replied my ancestor, ‘I am much obliged to
you for your information; but I am sorry to inform
you, that your relation has so endeared the
bit of your bridle to myself, that I have resolved
to keep it for your sake. I could not persuade
myself to part with it for any consideration
whatever.’—‘What!’ exclaimed the petrified
Kelpie, ‘do you really mean, in the face of our
solemn agreement, to retain the bit of my
bridle?’—‘I not only mean it, but I am resolved
on it,’ replies my ancestor, who immediately
proceeded to make the best of his way
home with the bit. ‘Come, come,’ the Kelpie
would perpetually exclaim, ‘you have carried
the joke far enough, you surely do not mean to
keep my bridle?’—‘Time will show,’ was always
his laconic answer. The Kelpie still continued
his earnest entreaties, interlarded with anecdotes
of great squabbles which he had formerly had
with as powerful characters as Mr. Macgrigor,
and which always ended to his eminent advantage,
but which, he politely insinuated, he would
be sorry to see repeated. But when his grief and
solicitude for his bridle began to evince themselves
in a threatening aspect, a single flourish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
of his trusty sword disarmed him of all his might,
and made him calm as a cat. At length, when
they arrived in sight of Mr. Macgrigor’s house,
his grief and despair for his bridle became perfectly
outrageous. Galloping off before Mr.
Macgrigor, the Kelpie told him as he went, that
he and the bit should never pass his threshold
together; and, in pursuance of this assurance,
he planted himself in Mr. Macgrigor’s door,
summoning up all his powers for the impending
conflict. However, James Macgrigor resolved,
if possible, to evade the Kelpie’s decree; and
accordingly going to a back window in his house,
he called his wife towards him, and threw the
bit of the Kelpie’s bridle into her lap. He then
returned to the Kelpie, who stood sentry at his
door, and told him candidly he was a miserable
legislator; for that, in spite of his decree, the
bit of his bridle was that moment in his wife’s
possession. The Kelpie, now finding himself
fairly outwitted, saw the vanity of contending
with James Macgrigor and his claymore, for
what could not be recovered. As there was a
rowan cross above the door, his kelpieship could
no more enter the house than he could pass
through the eye of a needle; and he, therefore,
thought it best to take himself off, holding forth,
at the same time, the most beastly language to
my ancestor, which he most sincerely despised.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">SPUNKIES.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Spunkie is another of those now-retired
ministers, formerly employed by the Enemy of
mankind to accomplish their destruction. And,
in all truth, he could not have taken into his
pay a servant more faithful to his trust than the
spunkie. Whenever the traveller had the misfortune
to lose his way, or whenever there was
a prospect of deluding him from it, this vigilant
<i>link-boy</i> was ever at hand, to light him into far
worse quarters than even the purlieus of Covent
Garden.</p>

<p>Suddenly the traveller’s attention was arrested
by the most resplendent light, apparently reflected
from a window not far distant; which,
however, as the traveller approached, receded
from him like the rainbow. Still pursuing his
course towards it, the wily spunkie manœuvred
so dexterously, that the unhappy wanderer was
speedily decoyed into the nearest moss or precipice.
Plunging headlong into some fatal abyss,
the deluded victim never returned to his mourning
wife and family, to relate to them the spunkie’s
perfidy.</p>

<p>Happily now, however, the roads are better,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
and travellers more cautious. All the glittering
meteors of the spunkie cannot make the
knowing Highlander of the present day turn to
the right or to the left. So that the spunkie
has now shut shop, and become bankrupt in his
department.</p>

ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF WITCHCRAFT.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are now come to consider and describe the
ancient and well-known order of Witchcraft;
the nature and object of which require very little
explanation in a country where it has been so
long established as in Scotland. Taking a retrospective
view of the rise and progress of this
once flourishing institution, we are told it was
founded by the Grand Master, shortly after the
creation of the world. That the wickedness of
the inhabitants having kept pace with their increase,
Satan found work multiplying so fast
on his hands, that his own spiritual minions,
numerous as they were, became inadequate to
their employment. Being seldom blind to his
own interest, the idea of enlisting a few human
instruments to supply their deficiencies naturally
suggested itself to his fertile genius, and
such has been the thirst for magic and power,
which has at all times pervaded the old women
of those countries, that he never had great difficulty
in procuring abundance of volunteers to
join his banners.</p>

<p>Having thus established his new order of
emissaries, Satan found them to answer his purposes
uncommonly well. They drudged on in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
his work so laboriously, and with such good success,
that he found them more profitable tools,
for deluding and <i>hooking-in</i> the best portion of
mankind, than his own proper agents, whose
means of communication and seduction were
much more confined and disadvantageous. Accordingly,
he has found it his interest to continue
the institution to this day.</p>

<p>It will, no doubt, prove a matter of some
astonishment to the amiable and considerate
reader, how any body that has the honour of
wearing a human face could think of espousing
so desperate a cause, for the sake of any gratification
which Satan’s kingdom affords. Common
fame errs too much, if he is at all a liberal
master to those who are his servants, for it is
said he seldom or never fulfils his conditions
with any one of them. Though mighty forward
to enter into pactions, and extraordinarily liberal
in his terms while making a bargain, he is said
to be far less ready to perform his share of the
conditions when it is once concluded; and what
is still worse, when he forfeits a penalty, there is
no law that can exact it of him. Accordingly,
we have heard of not a few deluded mortals, who
sold themselves to him for sums of money and
other considerations, but never yet heard of his
having paid the purchase money.</p>

<p>So once fared a poor needy wretch of a Highlandman,
that bartered his soul to Satan for a
cow, and who never could get the latter to fulfil
his bargain. It is no doubt true, that after
much importunity he did at length perform his
stipulation, in a way not very creditable to him.
Urgently importuned by the disponer to give
him his cow, he ultimately fetched him one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
which was but a few hours in his possession,
when it was challenged by a third party as his
stolen property; unwilling to explain how he
came by it, the poor fellow was flung into a
prison, and speedily brought before the laird
for trial. In this distressing situation, the disponer
was compelled to tell the truth and the
manner he came by the cow, not doubting but
that the disclosure would have at once exculpated
him from the charge. But unfortunately for
him, his ingenuous confession failed of its object,
and the poor man was condemned to the <i>wuddie</i>,
reserving to him such recourse against Satan as
he might be advised to adopt.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br>

OF THE AGENT’S QUALIFICATIONS, AND CEREMONIES OF THEIR
CONSTITUTION.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the candidates for Satan’s employment
have, by a course of probation, given sufficient
proofs of their ability for the discharge of the
duties of the profession they are about to adopt,
and when they have arrived at an age befitting
the importance of the calling, men and women
are equally eligible, though it is well known
that women are preferred. Their initiation into
infernal orders is preceded by the execution of
a formal covenant with Satan, sealed with the
mutual blood of the parties, whereby, for the
considerations therein expressed, Satan engages,
on the one hand, to commit to the entrant the
various powers and qualifications which shall be
detailed in the following pages; and, on the
other hand, the said entrant binds and obliges
himself, or herself, to apply himself, or herself,
faithfully and diligently in his service, by day
and by night, promising to conceal the secrets
of his trade and profession, (much in the style
of our common indentures). The candidates are
then inducted into the mysteries and secrets of
their new profession with great pomp, in presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
of the Royal Grand Master, who, set forth
in <i>proprio terrore</i>, presides over the ceremony.
The place selected for this imposing ceremony
is not unfrequently a spacious lake or pool, the
members of the craft in attendance being furnished
with their seaworthy navy, their brooms
and riddles. The following particulars relative
to an intended initiation, which was attempted
in Strathdown, “in the memory of the grandmothers
of some people still living,” while it
conveys some idea of such a scene as that to
which we alluded, may also prove a warning to
those who may be thoughtlessly led to embrace
the profession.</p>

<p>“In the time of my grandmother, the farm
of <i>Delnabo</i> was proportionally divided between
three tenants. At first equally comfortable in
their circumstances, it was in the course of some
time remarked by all, and by none more forcibly
than by one of the said three portioners,
that, although superior in point of industry and
talent to his two fellow-portioners, one of the
tenants was daily lapsing into poverty, while his
two neighbours were daily improving in estate.
Amazed and grieved at the adverse fortune which
thus attended his family, compared to the prosperous
condition of his neighbours, the wife of
the poor man was in the habit of expressing her
astonishment at the circumstance, not only to
her own particular friends, but likewise to the
wives of her neighbours themselves. On one
of these occasions, the other two wives asked her
what would she do to ameliorate her condition,
if it were in her power? She answered them, she
would do any thing whatever. (Here the other
wives thought they had got a gudgeon, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
would snap at any bait, and immediately resolved
to make her their confidant.) ‘Well, then,’
says one of the other two wives, ‘if you agree
to keep our communications strictly secret, and
implicitly obey our instructions, neither poverty
nor want shall ever assail you more.’ This
speech of the other wife immediately impressed
the poor man’s wife with a strong suspicion of
their real character. Dissembling all surprise
at the circumstance, she promised to agree to all
their conditions. She was then directed, when
she went to bed that night, to carry along with
her the floor-broom, well known for its magical
properties, which she was to leave by her husband’s
side in the course of the night, and which
would represent her so exactly, that the husband
could not distinguish the difference in the morning.
They, at the same time, enjoined her to
discard all fears of detection, as their own husbands
had been satisfied with those lovely substitutes
(the brooms) for a great number of
years. Matters being thus arranged, she was
desired to join them at the hour of midnight, in
order to accompany them to that scene which
was to realize her future happiness.</p>

<p>“Promising to attend to their instructions,
the poor man’s wife took leave of her neighbours,
full of those sensations of horror which the discovery
of such depravity was calculated to produce
in a virtuous mind. Hastening home to
her husband, she thought it no crime to break
her promise to her wicked neighbours, and, like
a dutiful and prudent wife, to reveal to the
husband of her bosom the whole particulars of
their interview. The husband greatly commended
his wife’s fidelity, and immediately entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
into a collusion with her, which displays
no ordinary degree of ingenuity. It was agreed
that the husband should exchange apparel with
the wife, and that he should, in this disguise,
accompany the wives to the place appointed, to
see what cantrips they intended to perform.
He accordingly arrayed himself in his wife’s
habiliments, and, at the hour of midnight, joined
the party at the place appointed. The ‘<i>Bride</i>,’
as they called him, was most cordially received
by the two Ladies of the Broom, who warmly
congratulated the ‘Bride’ upon <i>her</i> good fortune,
and the speedy consummation of <i>her</i> happiness.
He was then presented with a fir-torch,
a broom, and a riddle, articles with which they
themselves were furnished. They directed their
course along the banks of the rolling Avon, until
they reached Craic-pol-nain, or the Craig of the
Birdspool. Here, in consequence of the steepness
of the craig, they found it convenient to
pass to the other side of the river. This passage
they effected without the use of their navy, the
river being fordable at the place. They then
came in sight of Pol-nain, and, lo! what human
eye ever witnessed such a scene before! The
pool appeared as if actually enveloped in a flame
of fire. A hundred torches blazed aloft, reflecting
their beams on the towering woods of Loynchork.
And what ear ever heard such shrieks
and yells as proceeded from the horrid crew
engaged at their hellish orgies on Pol-nain?
Those cries were, however, sweet music to the
two wives of Delnabo. Every yell produced
from them a burst of unrestrained pleasure, and
away they frisked, leaving the amiable <i>bride</i> a
considerable way behind. For the fact is, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
he was in no hurry to reach the scene, and when
he did reach it, it was with a determination to
be only a spectator, and not a participator in the
night’s performance. On reaching the pool’s
side he saw what was going on,—he saw abundance
of hags steering themselves to and fro in
their riddles, by means of their oars the brooms,
hallooing and skirling worse than the bogles,
and each holding in her left hand a torch of fir,—whilst
at other times they would swirl themselves
into a row, and make profound obeisance
to a large black ugly tyke, perched on a lofty
rock, who was no doubt the ‘muckle thief’ himself,
and who was pleased to acknowledge most
graciously those expressions of their loyalty and
devotion, by bowing, grinning, and clapping his
paws. Having administered to the <i>bride</i> some
preliminary instructions, the impatient wives
desired him to remain by the pool’s side until
they should commune with his Satanic Highness
on the subject of <i>her</i> inauguration, directing <i>her</i>,
as they proceeded on their voyage across the
pool, to speed them in their master’s name. To
this order of the black pair the <i>bride</i> was
resolved to pay particular attention. As soon
as they were embarked in their riddles, and had
wriggled themselves, by means of their brooms,
into a proper depth of water, ‘Go,’ says he,
‘in the name of the Best.’ A horrid yell from
the witches announced their instant fate,—the
magic spell was now dissolved—crash went the
riddles, and down sank the two witches, never
more to rise, amidst the shrieks and lamentations
of the Old Thief and all his infernal crew, whose
combined power and policy could not save them
from a watery end. All the torches were extinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
in an instant, and the affrighted company
fled in different directions, in such forms
and similitudes as they thought most convenient
for them to adopt; and the <i>wily bride</i> returned
home at his leisure, enjoying himself vastly at
the clever manner in which he had executed the
instructions of his deceased friends. On arriving
at his house, he dressed himself in his own
clothes, and, without immediately satisfying his
wife’s curiosity at the result of his excursion, he
yoked his cattle, and commenced his morning
labours with as little concern as usual. His two
neighbours, who were not even conscious of the
absence of their wives, (so ably substituted were
they by the brooms,) did the same. Towards
breakfast-time, however, the two neighbours
were not a little astonished that they observed
no signs of their wives having risen from bed—notwithstanding
their customary earliness—and
this surprise they, expressed to the <i>late bride</i>,
their neighbour. The latter archly remarked,
that he had great suspicions, in his own mind, of
their <i>rising</i> even that day. ‘What mean you
by that?’ replied they. ‘We left our wives
apparently in good health when we ourselves
arose.’—‘Find them now,’ was the reply—the
bride setting up as merry a whistle as before.
Running each to his bed, what was the astonishment
of the husbands, when, instead of his wife,
he only found an old broom. Their neighbour
then told them, that, if they chose to examine
Pol-nain well, they would find both their dear
doxies there. The grieving husbands accordingly
proceeded thither, and, with the necessary
instruments, dragged their late worthy partners
to dry land; and afterwards privately interred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
them. The shattered vessels and oars of those
unfortunate navigators, whirling about the pool,
satisfied their lords of the manner by which they
came to their <i>ends</i>; and their names were no
longer mentioned by their kindred in the land.
It need scarcely be added, that the poor man
gradually recovered his former opulence; and
that, in the course of a short time, he was comparatively
as rich as he was formerly poor.”</p>

OF THE PERSONAL SIMILITUDE OF THE AGENTS OR MEMBERS
OF THE CRAFT.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is well known, that no sooner do men or
women enter on this profession, than there is a
striking change in their personal appearance.
Their countenances are no longer the emblems
of human nature, but the sign-posts of malice
and bad luck. “Looking like a witch” is a
proverb that has been always descriptive of the
most exquisite ugliness; and whoever has seen
the frontispiece of a Highland witch will be
satisfied with its force and propriety.</p>

<p>The face is so wrinkled, that it commonly
resembles the channels of dried waters, and the
colour of it resembles nothing so much as a piece
of rough tanned leather. The eyes are small
and piercing, sunk into the forehead, like the
expiring remains of a candle in a socket. The
nose is large, prominent, and sharp, forming a
bridge to the contacting chin. These are represented
as the amiable features of a witch. The
wizard’s appearance differs very little from that
of his amiable sister the witch, only that his face
is covered over with a preternatural redundance
of hair, and that he wears beneath his chin a
bunch of hair in the manner of a goat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>It has been long a subject of tough controversy
to what cause this striking deformity is
justly to be ascribed. Some logicians rationally
enough maintain, that the characteristic deformity
of the order arises from their frequent
interviews with Satan; that the tremor of the
limbs, the horror of the aspect, and stare of the
eyes, with which they are always seized during
the season of their noviciation, are rendered habitual
to them by the force of custom, which is
justly called a second nature. And, in support
of this doctrine, we are told it is a fact, that,
whenever we behold a ghost, or any other <i>uncanny</i>
being, our features become contracted
exactly the same way. But, be this as it may,
it is an acknowledged fact, that ugliness was,
from the beginning of their cast, their distinguishing
characteristic.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br>

OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL POWERS AND PRACTICES.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a nearer examination of a witch’s character,
we will find her face a very correct index to her
heart. She is the arch-enemy of whatever is
good and amiable. Invested as she is with as
ample powers of seduction and mischief as Satan
himself, she is equally expert in accomplishing
the ruin of the soul and body of the objects of
her malignity. In order to convey to the reader
an idea of those powers with which she is invested,
and which she never fails to exercise, we shall
detail them in their order, illustrating our statements,
as we go along, with proofs from the best
authorities.</p>

<p>The most formidable of all the powers conferred
on a witch consists in the torture and
destruction of human beings by infernal machination.
There are various processes by which
those hellish practices are accomplished, but the
most common process is that invented and used
by that eminent and distinguished witch, “<i>Crea
Mhoir cun Drochdair</i>,” who was burnt and worried
at a stake at Inverness, about two centuries
ago, for bewitching and keeping in torment the
body of the provost’s son. Crea made an effigy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
of clay and other hellish ingredients, into which
she stuck pins and other sharp instruments.
This effigy of the provost’s son she placed on a
spit at a large fire, and by these cantrips the
hag communicated such agonizing torments to
the young gentleman, that he must have had
speedily fallen a victim to his sufferings, had it
not been for the happy discovery made by means
of a little grandchild of Crea Mhoir’s, who
divulged the whole secret to a little companion,
for the small gratification of a piece of bread and
cheese. But although Crea, honest woman, was
long ago disposed of, to the great comfort and
satisfaction of her countrymen, who naturally
enough ascribed to her all the calamities which
happened in the country during her lifetime,
she left behind her the immortal fruits of her
genius, for the benefit of her black posterity, in
those mischievous inventions practised by the
witches of latter times, who understand the knack
of torturing their unhappy contemporaries in all
its branches, as exemplified in the cases of
several worthies noticed in the sequel.</p>

<p>The next important power of a witch and a
warlock consists in their control over air and
water, whereby they raise most dreadful storms
and hurricanes by sea and by land, and thus
accomplish the destruction of many a valuable
life, which otherwise might have been long
spared. The following account of the loss of a
most excellent gentleman exhibits too melancholy
an instance of the success of their experiments
in this way:</p>

<p>“John Garve Macgillichallum of Razay was
an ancient hero of great celebrity. Distinguished
in the age in which he lived for the gallantry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
of his exploits, he has often been selected by the
bard as the theme of his poems and songs.
Alongst with a constitution of body naturally
vigorous and powerful, Razay was gifted with
all those noble qualities of the mind which a true
hero is supposed to possess. And what reflected
additional lustre on his character, was that he
never failed to apply his talents and powers to
the best uses. He was the active and inexorable
enemy of the weird sisterhood, many of
whom he was the auspicious instrument of sending
to their ‘black inheritance’ much sooner
than they either expected or desired. It was
not therefore to be supposed, that, while those
amiable actions endeared Razay to all good
people, they were at all calculated to win him
the regard of those infernal hags to whom he
was so deadly a foe. As might be naturally expected,
they cherished towards him the most implacable
thirst of revenge, and sought, with unremitting
vigilance, for an opportunity of quenching
it. That such an opportunity did unhappily
occur, and that the meditated revenge of these
hags was too well accomplished, will speedily
appear from this melancholy story.</p>

<p>“It happened upon a time that Razay and a
number of friends planned an expedition to the
island of Lewes, for the purpose of hunting the
deer of that place. They accordingly embarked
on board the chieftain’s yacht, manned by the
flower of the young men of Razay, and in a few
hours they chased the fleet-bounding hart on the
mountains of Lewes. Their sport proved excellent.
Hart after hart, and hind after hind,
were soon levelled to the ground by the unerring
hand of Razay; and when night terminated the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
chase, they retired to their shooting quarters,
where they spent the night with joviality, and
mirth, little dreaming of their melancholy fate
in the morning.</p>

<p>“In the morning of next day, the chief of
Razay and his followers rose with the sun, with
the view of returning to Razay. The day was
squally and occasionally boisterous, and the
billows raged with great violence. But Razay
was determined to cross the channel to his residence,
and ordered his yacht to prepare for the
voyage. The more cautious and less courageous
of his suite, however, urged on him to defer the
expedition till the weather should somewhat
settle—an advice which Razay, with a courage
which knew no fear, rejected, and expressed his
firm determination to proceed without delay.
Probably with a view to inspire his company
with the necessary degree of courage to induce
them all to concur in the undertaking, he adjourned
with them to the ferry-house, where
they had recourse to that supporter of spirits
under every trial, the usquebaugh, a few bottles
of which added vastly to the resolution of the
company. Just as the party were disputing the
practicability of the proposed adventure, an old
woman, with wrinkled front, bending on a crutch,
entered the ferry-house; and Razay, in the heat
of argument, appealed to the old woman, whether
the passage of the channel on such a day was
not perfectly practicable and free from danger.
The woman, without hesitation, replied in the
affirmative, adding such observations, reflecting
on their courage, as immediately silenced every
opposition to the voyage; and accordingly the
whole party embarked in the yacht for Razay.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
But, alas! what were the consequences? No
sooner were they abandoned to the mercy of the
waves than the elements seemed to conspire to
their destruction. All attempts to put back the
vessel proved unavailing, and she was speedily
driven out before the wind in the direction of
Razay. The heroic chieftain laboured hard to
animate his company, and to dispel the despair
which began to seize them, by the most exemplary
courage and resolution. He took charge of
the helm, and, in spite of the combined efforts
of the sea, wind, and lightning, he kept the
vessel steadily on her course towards the lofty
point of Aird in Skye. The drooping spirits of
his crew began to revive, and hope began to
smile upon them—when lo! to their great
astonishment, a large cat was seen to climb the
rigging. This cat was soon followed by another
of equal size, and the last by a successor, until
at length the shrouds, masts, and whole tackle,
were actually covered with them. Nor did the
sight of all those cats, although he knew well
enough their real character, intimidate the resolute
Razay, until a large black cat, larger
than any of the rest, appeared on the masthead,
as commander-in-chief of the whole legion.
Razay, on observing him, instantly foresaw the
result; he, however, determined to sell his life
as dearly as possible, and immediately commanded
an attack upon the cats—but, alas! it
soon proved abortive. With a simultaneous
effort the cats overturned the vessel on her leeward
wale, and every soul on board was precipitated
into a watery grave. Thus ended the
glorious life of <i>Jan Garbh Macgillichallum</i> of
Razay, to the lasting regret of the brave clan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
Leod and all good people, and to the great satisfaction
of the abominable witches who thus accomplished
his lamentable doom.</p>

<p>“The same day, another hero, celebrated for
his hatred of witchcraft, was warming himself
in his hunting hut, in the forest of Gaick in
Badenoch. His faithful hounds, fatigued with
the morning chase, lay stretched on the turf by
his side,—his gun, that would not miss, reclined
in the neuk of the boothy,—the <i>skian dhu</i> of
the sharp edge hung by his side, and these alone
constituted his company. As the hunter sat
listening to the howling storm as it whistled by,
there entered at the door an apparently poor
weather-beaten cat, shivering with cold, and
drenched to the skin. On observing her, the
hairs of the dogs became erected bristles, and
they immediately rose to attack the pitiable cat,
which stood trembling at the door. ‘Great
hunter of the hills,’ exclaims the poor-looking
trembling cat, ‘I claim your protection. I know
your hatred to my craft, and perhaps it is just.
Still spare, oh spare a poor jaded wretch, who
thus flies to you for protection from the cruelty
and oppression of her sisterhood.’ Moved to
compassion by her eloquent address, and disdaining
to take advantage of his greatest enemy
in such a seemingly forlorn situation, he pacified
his infuriated dogs, and desired her to come forward
to the fire and warm herself. ‘Nay,’ says
she, ‘in the first place, you will please bind
with this long hair those two furious hounds of
yours, for I am afraid they will tear my poor
hams to pieces. I pray you, therefore, my dear
sir, that you would have the goodness to bind
them together by the necks with this long hair.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
But the curious nature of the hair induced the
hunter to dissemble a little. Instead of having
bound his dogs with it, as he pretended, he
threw it across a beam of wood which connected
the couple of the boothy. The witch then supposing
the dogs securely bound, approached the
fire, and squatted herself down as if to dry herself.
She had not sitten many minutes, when
the hunter could easily discover a striking increase
in her size, which he could not forbear
remarking in a jocular manner to herself. ‘A
bad death to you, you nasty beast,’ says the
hunter; ‘you are getting very large.’—‘Aye,
aye,’ replied the cat, equally jocosely, ‘as my
hairs imbibe the heat, they naturally expand.’
These jokes, however, were but a prelude to a
more serious conversation. The cat still continuing
her growth, had at length attained a
most extraordinary size,—when, in the twinkling
of an eye, she transformed herself into her
proper likeness of the Goodwife of Laggan, and
thus addressed him: ‘Hunter of the Hills, your
hour of reckoning is arrived. Behold me before
you, the avowed champion of my devoted sisterhood,
of whom Macgillichallum of Razay and
you were always the most relentless enemies.
But Razay is no more. His last breath is fled.
He lies a lifeless corpse on the bottom of the
main; and now, Hunter of the Hills, it is your
turn.’ With these words, assuming a most
hideous and terrific appearance, she made a
spring at the hunter. The two dogs, which she
supposed securely bound by the infernal hair,
sprung at her in her turn, and a most furious
conflict ensued. The witch, thus unexpectedly
attacked by the dogs, now began to repent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
her temerity. ‘<i>Fasten, hair, fasten</i>,’ she perpetually
exclaimed, supposing the dogs to have
been bound by the hair; and so effectually did
the hair <i>fasten</i>, according to her order, that it
at last snapt the beam in twain. At length,
finding herself completely overpowered, she
attempted a retreat, but so closely were the
hounds fastened in her breasts, that it was with
no small difficulty she could get herself disengaged
from them. Screaming and shrieking,
the Wife of Laggan dragged herself out of the
house, trailing after the dogs, which were fastened
in her so closely, that they never loosed
their hold until she demolished every tooth in
their heads. Then metamorphosing herself into
the likeness of a raven, she fled over the mountains
in the direction of her home. The two
faithful dogs, bleeding and exhausted, returned
to their master, and, in the act of caressing his
hand, both fell down and expired at his feet.
Regretting their loss with a sorrow only known
to the parent who weeps over the remains of
departed children, he buried his devoted dogs,
and returned home to his family. His wife was
not in the house when he arrived, but she soon
made her appearance. ‘Where have you been,
my love?’ inquired the husband.—‘Indeed,’
replies she, ‘I have been seeing the Goodwife
of Laggan, who has been just seized with so
severe an illness, that she is not expected to live
for any time.’—‘Aye! aye!’ says he, ‘what is
the matter with the worthy woman?’—‘She
was all day absent in the moss at her peats,’
replies the wife, ‘and was seized with a sudden
colic, in consequence of getting wet feet, and
now all her friends and neighbours are expecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
her demision.’—‘Poor woman,’ says the
husband, ‘I am sorry for her. Get me some
dinner, it will be right that I should go and see
her also.’ Dinner being provided and dispatched,
the hunter immediately proceeded to the house
of Laggan, where he found a great assemblage
of neighbours mourning, with great sincerity,
the approaching decease of a woman whom they
all had hitherto esteemed virtuous. The hunter,
walking up to the sick woman’s bed in a rage,
proportioned to the greatness of its cause, stripped
the sick woman of all her coverings. A
shriek from the now exposed witch brought all
the company around her. ‘Behold,’ says he,
‘the object of your solicitude, who is nothing
less than an infernal witch. To-day, she informs
me, she was present at the death of the
Laird of Razay, and only a few hours have
elapsed since she attempted to make me share
his fate. This night, however, she shall expiate
her crime, by the forfeiture of her horrid life.’
Relating to the company the whole circumstances
of her attack upon him, which were too
well corroborated by the conclusive marks she
bore on her person, the whole company were
perfectly convinced of her criminality; and the
customary punishment was about to be inflicted
on her, when the miserable wretch addressed
them as follows: ‘My ill-requited friends, spare
an old acquaintance, already in the agonies of
death, from any farther mortal degradation.
My crimes and my folly now stare me in the
face, in their true colours, while my vile and perfidious
seducer, the enemy of your temporal and
spiritual interests, only laughs at me in my distress;
and, as a reward for my fidelity to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
interest, in seducing every thing that was amiable,
and in destroying every thing that was
good, he is now about to consign my soul to
eternal misery. Let my example be a warning
to all the people of the earth to shun the fatal
rock on which I have split; and as a strong inducement
for them to do so, I shall atone for
my iniquity to the utmost of my ability, by detailing
to you the awful history of my life.’
Here the Wife of Laggan detailed at full length
the way she was seduced into the service of the
evil one,—all the criminal adventures in which
she had been engaged, and ended with a particular
account of the death of Macgillichallum
of Razay, and her attack upon the hunter, and
then expired.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, a neighbour of the Wife of
Laggan was returning home late at night from
Strathdearn, where he had been upon some
business, and had just entered the dreary forest
of Monalea in Badenoch, when he met a woman
dressed in black, who ran with great speed, and
inquired of the traveller, with great agitation,
how far she was distant from the church-yard of
Dalarossie, and if she could be there by twelve
o’clock. The traveller told her she might, if
she continued to go at the same pace that she
did then. She then fled alongst the road, uttering
the most desponding lamentations, and the
traveller continued his road to Badenoch. He
had not, however, walked many miles when he
met a large black dog, which travelled past him
with much velocity, as if upon the scent of a
track or footsteps, and soon after he met another
large black dog sweeping along in the same
manner. The last dog, however, was scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
past, when he met a stout black man on a fine
fleet black courser, prancing along in the same
direction after the dogs. ‘Pray,’ says the rider
to the traveller, ‘did you meet a woman as you
came along the hill?’ The traveller replied in
the affirmative. ‘And did you meet a dog soon
after?’ rejoined the rider. The traveller replied
he did. ‘And,’ added the rider, ‘do you
think the dog will overtake her ere she can
reach the church of Dalarossie?’—‘He will, at
any rate, be very close upon her heels,’ answered
the traveller. Each then took his own way.
But before the traveller had got the length of
Glenbanchar, the rider overtook him on his
return, with the foresaid woman before him
across the bow of his saddle, and one of the dogs
fixed in her breast, and another in her thigh.
‘Where did you overtake the woman?’ inquired
the traveller. ‘Just as she was entering the
church-yard of Dalarossie,’ was his reply. On
the traveller’s return home, he heard of the fate
of the unfortunate Wife of Laggan, which soon
explained the nature of the company he had met
on the road. It was, no doubt, the spirit of
the Wife of Laggan flying for protection from
the infernal spirits, (to whom she had sold herself,)
to the church-yard of Dalarossie, which is
so sacred a place, that a witch is immediately
dissolved from all her ties with Satan, on making
a pilgrimage to it, either dead or alive.
But it seems the unhappy Wife of Laggan was
a stage too late.”</p>

<p>There is another power given to them, which
is a most mischievous one, and proves the fruitful
source of almost all the crimes and miseries
which deluge the land,—that of sowing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
seeds of discord amongst mankind in public and
private life. We will say nothing of the degree
of secret influence which these worthies probably
enjoy in overruling the councils of our nation,
and thwarting the judgment of our ministers,
so as to answer their private purposes, as it
would be out of our strict line of delineation.
But we speak from the best authority when we
say, that they are the common and secret instigators
of those deplorable quarrels and divisions
which sometimes happen between those who
ought to be one flesh. Whenever we see a
broken-hearted wife mourning over the misconduct
of her husband, who, once tenderly
affectionate and attentive to the discharge of
his domestic duties, is now changed into the
domestic tyrant and whisky-bibber, we need
never hesitate for a moment to pronounce the
cause to be witchcraft. And the same rule
holds good in regard to the misconduct of the
wife, <i>vice versa</i>. Behold, again, the man of sin,
clothed in the garment of disgrace, that sits
“<i>girnan on the creepy.</i>” Ask him what blind-fold
infatuation could have induced him to have
defiled his neighbour’s bed, and he will tell you,
with a groan, it was “<i>Buchuchd</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>Nor are their operations confined to the
injury of a person’s spiritual interest alone—they
even descend to the lowest incidents in a
man’s calling. If the reader should see a termagant
of a wife raise over the <i>caput</i> of her
poor cuckold of a husband the tongs or spurtle,
demanding of him, with vehement eloquence,
the cause of purchasing a horse or a cow at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
double its value, his answer to her will certainly
be—“Me ve ar mu Buchuchd.”</p>

<p>Thus the ruination of our spiritual interest
is not enough to satisfy their inveterate malignity,—they
must likewise injure our temporal
interests, which, however incomparable to the
former in point of intrinsic importance, yet
cause the sufferer fully as much grief. Indeed,
so dearly do the most of the people of this
world love their temporal means and estate,
that we feel fully persuaded, that did those
agents confine their operations to the injury of
our spiritual interests alone, which, as Satan’s
instruments, we should naturally suppose to be
their proper line of business, the clamour against
their ruinous and abominable practices would be
much less violent than it is. This much, however,
of the Highlander’s liberal disposition
the sly sounding witch is intimately acquainted
with, and for this very reason she redoubles
her diligence to cause him all the loss in her
power, as the most effectual way of completing
his misery. Hence it oftens happens, that
should a horse, an ox, or a cow, of unequalled
symmetry and beauty, be so unlucky as to
attract the favour of its affectionate owner;—by
whatever means the sagacious witch discovers
the secret we know not, but certain annihilation,
accomplished by some means or other, will
be the poor animal’s lot. Such a calamity as
this is sufficiently mortifying, but it is a small
one when compared to the loss of a person’s
whole stock, which too frequently follows the
loss of one. Having once inserted the infernal
pillow into some snug corner, its influence will
give the finishing stroke to all the cattle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
creeping things on a farm. This pillow, not to
give it a worse name, is a little four-cornered
<i>bag</i>, packed with divers exterminating diseases,
in the familiar likeness of hair, grease, parings
of nails, shoe tackets, salt, powder, and other
infernal knick-knacks, too tedious to be described,
which, when thrown into the fire, makes
a noise the like of which has seldom been heard.</p>

<p>No sooner is this bag deposited in a cleft in
the stable or byre than it commences its destructive
career, producing the death of the
bestial in whole lots, until the last hen on the
roost will fall a sacrifice to its deadly influence.
Nor is this all; they will attach some infernal
cantrips to the farming-utensils that no good
crop will follow their operations, and what may
escape the influence of the <i>baggie</i> is commonly
destroyed by frost, rain, lightning, and other
calamities, which the craft can produce at their
pleasure, so that it is unfit for the use of man or
beast. In short, of all the ills incident to the
life of man, none are so formidable as witchcraft,
before the combined influence of which,
to use the language of an honest man who had
himself severely suffered from its effects, “the

OF THE WITCH’S POWERS OF TRANSFORMATION.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> of our readers who are not very well
acquainted with the theory of witchcraft will
not be a little surprised, at the unaccountable
activity of its agents, who are capable of paying
not only proper attention to their own private
affairs, but likewise of carrying on almost
all the business of the Evil One in this land.
In order to obviate all surprise on this head, be
it remembered, that they are endowed with as
ample powers of transmigration (at their institution
into the craft) as any other of Satan’s
spiritual agents; consequently there is no similitude
from their own proper likenesses to that
of a cat or a stone, but they can assume at
pleasure. Hence the speed and privacy with
which they attain their evil ends.</p>

<p>One of the most ordinary disguises of a “<i>Ban-Buchichd</i>”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
is the similitude of a hare. This
transformation she finds exceedingly convenient
while performing her cantrips in the field—bewitching
farming implements—destroying corn
and grass—holding communion with the sisterhood,
and similar pieces of business. It enables<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
her to execute her undertakings with greater
expedition, and flee more fleetly on any emergency,
than she could do in any other character.</p>

<p>A second is the likeness of a cat—by personating
which, she procures admission to the inmost
recesses of a house, to deposit her infernal
machinery, without exciting the least suspicions
of her real character and intentions.</p>

<p>A third is her transformation into a stone,
which is a common practice with the witch in
the season of agricultural operations, by which
she is afforded great opportunities of mischief
to the farmer’s interest. The wily witch will
penetrate into the ground, and place herself in
the line of the plough, and as it passes her she
will creep in betwixt the sock and the culter.
The plough is consequently expelled from the
ground for a considerable space, and a “<i>bauk</i>”
is the consequence. For these insidious and
barefaced acts of iniquity, the witch, if discovered,
seldom escapes with impunity. Stopping
the cattle, the ploughman will take hold of
the stone, bestowing upon it the most abusive
and opprobrious epithets, and dashes her with
all his might against the hardest substance he
can find, as a mark of his hatred and contempt
for her character.</p>

<p>A fourth is her transformation into the shape
of a raven; which now in a great measure
supersedes the use of her ancient and renowned
hobby-horse the broom, on which she formerly
walloped with such surprising velocity. This
similitude is commonly assumed by her when
on excursions to any distance, to attend the
counsels of Satan—to hold communion with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the sisterhood—or to attend some important
enterprise.</p>

<p>The witch likewise assumes the character of
a <i>magpie</i> on occasions of sudden emergency
which require immediate conference with a number
of the members of the craft. The likeness
of this bird, which is of a domestic character,
and fond of hopping and picking about the
doors, screens the witch from suspicion, as she
visits another witch’s dwelling. Hence, when a
number of magpies convene together side by
side on a house-top, it is no wonder that their
appearance should occasionally excite suspicion.
But we humbly think that mere suspicion by
no means justifies that hostility of temper which
in several districts the inhabitants are led to
entertain against the whole race of magpies,
merely because the witches sometimes assume
their similitude. These suspicions are no doubt
a good deal heightened by the circumstance of
the poor magpie’s being a little endowed with
the gift of prophecy. As a foreteller of minor
events—such as the coming of visitors, the change
of weather, and such-like little occurrences—the
magpie has never been excelled; and notwithstanding
the illiberal conduct of its human
neighbours, those little qualities are always
exerted by the magpie for their comfort and
convenience.</p>

<p>On the morning of that auspicious day on
which the factor, the parson, or any other of the
country gentry of equal importance, is to pay a
visit to the lord of the manor on which the magpie
may have pitched her residence, she will
approach the house, and, by her incessant chattering,
announce to the inhabitants the coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
of the consequential stranger. The state apartment,
perhaps rather deranged, is consequently
arrayed in proper order; and the necessary provisions
to entertain the expected guests are
timeously procured, which, but for the magpie’s
generous and ill-rewarded premonition, could
not perhaps be provided for the occasion.</p>

SAFEGUARDS FROM WITCHCRAFT.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> witchcraft is in itself by far the greatest calamity
the Highlander is subject to, so Providence,
in its wise economy, has afforded him
the amplest means of guarding against its
effects. And if a radical remedy has not yet
been discovered for the evil in all its bearings,
it is only because mankind have not been equally
solicitous for the discovery of it. Adverse to a
murmuring discontented spirit, the Highlander
is satisfied with the removal of a share of his
grievances. Having obtained a knowledge of a
certain remedy for those practices of the craft
which weigh most heavily on his temporal interests,
he is not so presumptuous as to suppose
that Providence is so partial in its favours
as to grant him a remedy for those that affect his
immortal interests also. Satisfied with the benefits
he enjoys, he is not clamorous for an extension
of them, leaving the concerns of another
world for a season of more convenience and
leisure.</p>

<p>As a sovereign protection for goods and chattels
of every description from the machinations
of those despicable agents, the rowan cross, of
invaluable excellence, has never been known to
prove ineffectual. Its salutary influence on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
every species of supernatural agents is well
known, and there are none to whom the smell
of the rowan is more obnoxious than the “Ban
Buchuchd.” As a proof of its efficacy, we can
produce no better authority than the following
affecting story:—</p>

<p>“There is, in the vicinity of Forres, an old
decayed edifice, called ‘<i>Castle Boorgie</i>,’ in which
once lived a rich laird, who had a beautiful
daughter. Seemingly possessed of every engaging
accomplishment, and apparently endowed
with the most amiable disposition, she was the
darling of her aged father, whose hopes and
joys were wholly centered in her. One spring
morning, as her father and herself were surveying
the delightful prospects which the castle
commanded, the immense number of ploughs at
work within the compass of their vision happened
to attract their attention. ‘Father,’ says
this ill-fated, unconscious child, ‘do we not
behold a vast number of ploughs in the widely-extended
district now in our view?’—‘Yes, my
love, we do,’ replied the father, ‘and it is a
pleasant thing to look at them.’—‘What reward
will you give me,’ added she, ‘if, by a single
word, I shall cause them all stand as immoveable
as if the cattle were transformed into stones?’—‘On
that condition,’ replied the astonished
father, ‘the most superb and costly gown in the
town of Forres shall be yours.’—‘It is done,’
says the daughter. Raising her hand, she muttered
an unintelligible sound, and, lo! all the
ploughs in the district, with the exception of a
single one, stood stock still and immoveable.—‘Indeed!’
exclaims the father, ‘you are a rare
conjuror, my dear; but how is that plough in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the adjacent park exempted from the magical
effect of your powerful charm?’—‘The cause I
can easily guess,’ says she; ‘there is, in one of
the oxen’s bows, a pin of the rowan tree, the
virtue of which defeats all attempts at preternatural
fascination.’—‘Aye, aye,’ says he, ‘all
those things are wonderfully pretty; pray who
taught them to you?’—‘My old nurse taught
me those fine things, and am not I greatly
obliged to her, sir?’—‘You are, undoubtedly,’
he replies, ‘and she shall soon have her reward.
Oh! my dear, my only child—support and comfort
of my aged head—would to God you had
never been born!’</p>

<p>“Summoning immediately a council of his
friends, the broken-hearted parent revealed to
them the whole circumstance, and craved their
opinion as to the measures that should be adopted
in this deeply-to-be-deplored case. After due
consultation, the council gave it as their decided
opinion, that, concluding that she was irrecoverably
lost to all good in this world, the extension
of her life would be only productive of eternal
disgrace and infamy to her friends, while her
spiritual interests would every day be destroyed
by accumulating guilt. Therefore, that her life
should be instantly terminated by a private
death; and that the old hag, the author of her
ruin, should be publicly burned under every
ignominious circumstance. To this hard decision
the agonised father was persuaded to assent;
and a doctor was immediately dispatched
for to Forres, to point out the easiest mode of
taking her life. Bleeding the temporal arteries
was the mode of death agreed on, and the poor
innocent victim of the old hag’s depravity was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
introduced into a private apartment, in order to
undergo the awful operation. On entering the
apartment, her unhappy father burst out into a
flood of tears. Observing his distress, his affectionate
little daughter also fell a crying. ‘What
is the matter with you, my dear father?’ says
she. ‘Have you received any bad news? Oh!
tell me what is the matter with you, that I may
share your sorrows and dry your tears.’ Fearing
that the father’s courage might naturally
fail him under so signal a trial, the friends present
instantly seized the astonished dear girl,
bound her hand and foot, and placed her in a
vat, and the surgeon inflicted on her two brows,
fair and beautiful as those of an angel, the fatal
wounds. As the blood flowed, the poor affrighted
victim perpetually exclaimed, ‘Do not kill me,
do not kill me; what have I done to offend my
dearest father? I am sure I did no harm. For
the sake of my dear mother, who is no more,
and for whose sake you loved me so well, do not
let them kill me, my dear father.’ The unhappy
father sunk senseless on the floor, and his
expiring child soon closed her eyes on this world,
sighing, with her last breath, ‘My dearest
father, do not kill me.’</p>

<p>“The old hag was then brought out to the
lawn in front of the castle, and thrown into a
huge furnace of tar and other combustibles,
amidst the general execration of the assembled
multitude. And it is said, that while the witch
was burning, every crack she gave was as loud
as the report of a war cannon.”</p>

<p>When, by the neglect of the prescribed safeguards,
the seeds of iniquity have taken root,
and a person’s means are decaying in consequence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
the only alternative, in this case, is to
resort to that grand remedy, the “<i>Tein Econuch</i>,”
or “<i>Forlorn Fire</i>,” which seldom fails of
being productive of the best effects. The cure
for witchcraft, called “<i>Tein Econuch</i>,” is
wrought in the following manner:—</p>

<p>A consultation being held by the unhappy
sufferer and his friends as to the most advisable
measures of effecting a cure, if this process is
adopted, notice is privately communicated to all
those householders who reside within the nearest
two running streams, to extinguish their
lights and fires on some appointed morning.
On its being ascertained that this notice has been
duly observed, a spinning-wheel, or some other
convenient instrument, calculated to produce
fire by friction, is set to work with the most
furious earnestness by the unfortunate sufferer
and all who wish well to his cause. Relieving
each other by turns, they drive on with such
persevering diligence, that at length the spindle
of the wheel, ignited by excessive friction, emits
“<i>Forlorn Fire</i>” in abundance, which, by the
application of tow, or some other combustible
material, is widely extended over the whole
neighbourhood. Communicating the fire to the
tow, the tow communicates it to a candle, the
candle to a fir-torch, the torch to a cartful of
peats, which the master of the ceremonies, with
pious ejaculations for the success of the experiment,
distributes to messengers, who will proceed
with portions of it to the different houses
within the said two running streams, to kindle
the different fires. By the influence of this
operation, the machinations and spells of witchcraft
“are rendered null and void,” and, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
language of Scots’ law, “of no avail, force,
strength, or effect, with all that has followed, or
may follow thereupon.”</p>

<p>But should the evil prove so obstinate and
deep-rooted as to triumph over this most commonly
efficacious remedy, the dernier resort is
an application to that arch-enemy of Satan, Mr.
Grigor Willox Macgrigor, Emperor of all the
Conjurors.</p>

<p>The name of this gentleman is well known to
the inhabitants of the northern counties of Scotland,
as the happy proprietor of that invaluable
and wonderful relic, which the vulgar are sometimes
pleased to denominate “Clach Ghrigair
Willock,” alias “<i>Clach Ban na Buchuchd</i>,”
but which, in our opinion, deserves a far more
dignified, if not a more appropriate appellation.
We humbly submit it should be called the
<i>Philosopher’s Stone</i>, not so much out of compliment
to its learned and elegant proprietor—although,
by the bye, he is wonderfully <i>philosophic</i>—as
out of pure justice to the stone itself;
for it certainly is the best substitute for the
grand object of the chemist’s research that has
hitherto been discovered. If the philosopher’s
stone will convert metal into gold, the “warlock’s
stone” will convert water into silver by a
process perhaps more round-about, but equally
certain.</p>

<p>The history of such a precious curiosity as
this would, no doubt, prove highly interesting
to the “curious reader;” and the writer has to
blame the shortness of his memory for not
gratifying him to the utmost of his wish, Mr.
Willox having more than once personally favoured
him with a very eloquent account of it. Suffice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
it to say, that this stone was originally extorted
by a very ancient ancestor of Mr. Willox
from an amorous slut of a mermaid, who, unfortunately
for her, happened to take a fancy to
him, and no wonder, too, if he possessed in any
degree the personal attractions of his lineal
posterity. It happened, then, that this silly
fool of a mermaid once thought it proper to
throw herself in this gentleman’s way, expecting,
no doubt, very different treatment from that
which she experienced,—when her unnatural
sweetheart, instead of offering her any endearments,
most ungraciously chained her to a post,
until she redeemed her liberty by this precious
ransom. This was, no doubt, long, long ago,
nobody knows how long, and the <i>stone</i> has
necessarily seen many revolutions of times and
masters in the course of its day. It graced for
a long time the warlike standard of the brave
clan Gregor, combining, as the upholsterer says,
“great ornament with much utility;” for, while
it served to set off not a little those splendid
banners, it invariably secured their followers
victory over their contending foes. It afterwards
returned to the Willox family, with whom
it has continued to the present day. It could
not descend to a race of gentlemen who could
do greater justice to its excellent qualities, and
certainly the fault cannot be traced to the
present proprietor, if, during his liferent use
of it, the stone has lost an iota of its former
celebrity.</p>

<p>Whatever might have been the ornamental
qualities of this wonderful <i>stone</i> in the days of
yore, it has now no great ornaments to boast of.
It is a plain-looking article, strongly resembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
the knob or bottom of a crystal bottle; and were
it not that Mr. Willox solemnly assured us of
his having been told by the great Lord Henderland
himself, it must have at one time composed
one of the Pleiades, we should have had much
difficulty in believing it to consist of any other
substance; but who could resist such respectable
authority?<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> Although Mr. Willox informed
us that a single collision with the ground would
instantly divest it of all its wonderful virtues,
the stone certainly bears <i>ex facie</i> marks of rough
usage, and even such inauspicious accidents as
coming into contact with the ground, or perhaps
harder materials, in its time. However, the
<i>stone</i> itself will tell no secrets, and on the subject
of accidents of this sort it is the proprietor’s
interest to be equally mute.</p>

<p>But whatever may be the nature and qualities
of this stone, its virtues are sufficiently notorious.
A single immersion of it into a hogshead of
water instantaneously communicates to it such
inconceivable virtue, that one drop of it is sufficient
to cure the most desperate case of witchcraft
in the land. Nor do the prevention and
cure of witchcraft alone constitute the stone’s
sole line of business;—for a valuable reward,
there is no secret or calamity natural to man
or beast in all this wide world, but it will reveal
or prevent.—<i>Exemple gratia</i>: should some
miserable vagabond of a thief, residing within
the pale of Mr. Willox’s celebrity, be so fool-hardy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
as to lay his dishonest hands upon the
goods or chattels of a neighbour, recovery of
the goods, or at least an exposure of the thief,
is the absolute consequence. The loser of the
goods looks about him for his purse, and immediately
proceeds to consult the <span class="smcap">Grand Oracle</span>,
Mr. Grigor Willox, as to the person who had
the effrontery to steal his goods. Mr. Willox,
willing to afford every information on reasonable
terms, instantly produces the black stocking
containing the stone, a single dip of which
clearly developes the whole circumstance. After
a long consultation, involving some inquiries as
to suspected characters, the lynx-eyed Mr.
Willox easily recognises some figures reflected
on the vessel containing the water by the stone,
conveying an exact representation of some old
hag not very reputable for her habits, residing
in the complainant’s neighbourhood; and thus
all doubt is removed as to his suspicions being
too well founded.</p>

<p>It is no subject for wonder, then, that this
Great Oracle should be so highly prized and
suitably encouraged. With commendable regard
to the good of his beloved countrymen, Mr.
Willox is in the habit of <i>occasionally</i> making a
tour of pleasure through the counties of Inverness,
Ross, and Caithness, whence, after some
weeks’ absence, he returns home, with the
double satisfaction of thinking, that while he
has, in the course of his rambles, conferred the
greatest benefit on suffering humanity, he has,
at the same time, a good deal improved his own
pecuniary resources. Those occasional peregrinations
of this gentleman are now become absolutely
necessary. Funds are not only very low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
in these bad times, but Mr. Willox is convinced
more and more, every day he rises, of the truth
of that proverb, “A prophet has no honour in
his own country;” and he therefore finds it no
less his interest than his duty to take a trip,
as occasion suggests, to see his friends in the
<i>Duigh Tua</i>.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> For the most part, however, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
resides at his seat of Gaulrig in Strathavon
(usually called Strathdown), where, like the late
Doctor Samuel Solomon, inventor and proprietor
of that renovating cordial the Balm of Gilead,
he may be consulted, either personally or
by letter post paid, on payment of the usual
compliment of a pound note. Accordingly, there
are pilgrimages made to Gaulrig as well as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
Gilead House. It is no rare matter for the inhabitants
of both sides of the Avon to fall in
with unfortunate pilgrims, whose longitude of
face and decrepitude of limbs indicate the extent
of their misfortunes and the length of their journey,
inquiring the way for <i>Taigh Maishter Willack</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the whole series of annual festivals, Hallowe’en
forms the most important occasion in
the Highlands of Scotland. The fascinating
round of varied enjoyments the night presents
to the young and juvenile—the delightful peeps
into futurity it affords to the enchanted lover—and
the fond recollections it revives in old age—all
conspire to render its approach more interesting,
and its celebration more joyful, than
any other occasion within the compass of the
year. Nor is the happy influence diffused by
Hallowe’en confined to the human class of the
inhabitants of the Highlands alone; most of the
<i>supernatural inhabitants</i> are in some degree partakers
in the general happiness. With the fairy
community, in particular, it is an occasion of
peculiar grandeur, as the great anniversary on
which they are reviewed by <i>Auld Nick</i>, their
nominal chief potentate, in person; whilst many
others of the classes treated of in the foregoing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
pages regard it as a night of no ordinary pomp
and joviality.</p>

<p>On this occasion of universal hilarity, the natural
coldness and jealousy which generally subsist
between the human species and their supernatural
neighbours are changed into perfect
harmony and benevolence. Like two belligerent
armies, whose hostility towards each
other is more the offspring of public duty than
private resentment, and who, therefore, during
the intervals of war, exhibit in their mutual intercourse
the marks of personal good will; so,
in like manner, those two classes forget for the
night all animosity, in their more laudable zeal
to contribute to each other’s gratification. Nay,
stern Satan himself relaxes for this night his
avarice; and, alive to no other object than the
promotion of universal enjoyments, dispatches
showers of his emissaries to the several kiln-pots,
peat-stacks, and barn-yards in the Highlands,
to afford to those adventurers who desire
it a peep into the secrets of futurity.</p>

<p>Such a display of seeming benevolence, did it
proceed from any other individual than Satan,
could not fail to meet with some share of applause.
But heads of families, whose opinions
are entitled to some respect, have been known
to affirm, that Satan’s affected generosity on
this occasion is nothing but a mere stratagem
for inveigling the more effectually the young
and unwary into his vile snares, and that he
gets more game by those specious artifices than
he could realize by any other means. Hence it
is that the anxious parent this night, instead
of extolling Satan’s generosity, is so intent on
magnifying his perfidy; and in order the better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
to dissuade his offspring and family from the
dangerous practices of the night, details, without
qualification, his numerous treacheries on
similar occasions.</p>

<p>But these ebullitions of the parent’s jealousy
of Satan’s practices are soon subdued. The
big-bellied bottle and bumper-glass will have a
great effect in relaxing his heart of its illiberal
suspicions. Speedily animated by the conciliating
qualities of the “<i>barley-bree</i>,” and softened
by the recollection of his own youthful
frolics and manly deeds on similar occasions, he
no longer regards as a crime those practices
which he recently condemned; and the good-natured
matron, being happy at her husband’s
felicity, and averse to chide, they both tacitly
connive at the family’s indulgence in the customary
arts of divination.</p>

<p>Generally the first spell they try is pulling
the stock of kail. Joining hand in hand they
go forth to the kail-yard, previously blind-folded,
lads, lasses, and children, equally anxious
to have their fortunes told as their seniors.
Pulling the first stock they meet with, they
immediately return to the light to have an examination
of its qualities; its being large or
little, straight or crooked, is prophetic of the
size and shape of its puller’s conjugal companion.
If any earth adheres to the root, it indicates
tocher or fortune; and the taste of the custoc or
stem, whether sour or sweet, shows the nature
of his disposition.</p>

<p>They go next to the barn-yard, and pull each
a stalk of oats, and according to the number of
grains upon the stalk the puller will have a corresponding
number of children. It may be observed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
that it is essential to a female’s good
fame that her stalk should have the top-grain
attached to it.</p>

<p>An individual goes to the barn, opens both
its doors, then takes the instrument used in
winnowing corn, called a <i>wecht</i>, and goes through
all the gestures of letting down corn against the
wind. This is repeated three several times, and
the third time an apparition will pass through
the barn, in at the one door and out at the
other, having a retinue emblematical of his or
her station in life.</p>

<p>A person goes privately to <i>Tor-na-ha</i>, or the
kiln-pot, throws into it a clew of blue thread,
which the person winds into a new clew.
Towards the latter end something will hold the
thread, on which the person demands, “Who
holds?” An answer will be returned by the
agent below, by naming the Christian name and
sirname of the person’s future spouse.</p>

<p>A person steals out unperceived to the peat-stack—sows
a handful of hemp-seed, calling out
something to the following effect:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Hemp-seed, I saw thee,</div>
<div class="verse">Hemp-seed, I saw thee,</div>

<p>And, on looking over his shoulder, he sees the
apparition of the person invoked in the attitude
of pulling the hemp, which had immediately
grown at the magic command. Or, if hemp-seed
is not at hand, let the person take the
floor-besom, which he will ride in the manner of
a witch three times round the peat-stack, and
the last time the apparition will appear to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>They go one or more to what is called a <i>dead
and living ford</i>, or, in other words, a ford which
has been crossed by a funeral, and observing
profound silence, dip the sleeve of their shirt
in it. On returning home they go to bed in
sight of a fire, and, lying awake in bed, they
will observe an apparition, being an exact similitude
of the grand object in question, turn the
shirt-sleeve, as if to dry the other side.</p>

<p>An individual goes to a public road, which
branches in three several directions, (<i>i. e.</i> the
junction of three roads,) bearing with him the
cutty or three-legged stool, on which the person
seats himself just on the eve of twelve o’clock;
and, as the hour strikes, he hears proclaimed the
names of the several persons who shall die in the
parish before the next anniversary. <i>Nota.</i>—If
the person carries along with him articles of
wearing-apparel, and throws an article away on
the proclamation of each person’s name, it will
rescue the person from his impending fate; and
it will be wise to retain one article to the last,
in case his own name may be called, when he
has not the means of redemption at hand.</p>

<p>These and some other out-of-door spells having
been tried, the parties return to the dwelling-house
to burn the nuts. Burning the nuts
is a very popular charm. They name a lad and
a lass to each particular nut, as they lay them
in the fire, and, accordingly, as they burn
quietly, or start from beside one another, so the
issue of the courtship will be.</p>

<p>A person takes a candle and goes unattended
to a looking-glass—eats an apple before it,
combing his or her hair all the while, occasionally
holding over the shoulder a table-fork with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
a piece of the apple upon it, and ultimately the
adventurer’s conjugal partner will be seen in the
glass, in the attitude of taking the proffered
piece of apple.</p>

<p>These and some other spells of less note, such
as dipping for the apple, groping for the clean
dish, which are generally known, and, therefore,
need not be particularly described, joined
to each individual’s relation of the sights which
he saw on the present and former occasions, together
with the reflections they draw from
“narrative old age,” bring the well-buttered
sowans, or more favoured <i>Banbrishd</i><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> upon the
table. The <i>sonsie</i> kebbock is roasted at the
fire, and fangs cut down from end to end. Brandered
bannocks, and every other luxury that
can be procured, load the hospitable board.
The welcome guests surround it; the silver
head is bared with solemn reverence, and the
temperate feast, qualified with a few rounds of
the <i>Boghtle dhu</i>, is as much relished as if it
consisted of the most delicious luxuries that
crown a monarch’s board. But the hours are
too happy to remain long;—they flee like a
shadow, and call the guests to their respective
homes. Each swain and damsel now repose
themselves on their pillows, full of those tender
emotions which the night’s amusements excited,
and in their midnight slumbers see those objects
whose image they so ardently wished to
see in all their comeliness and beauty.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHRISTMAS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The children of years to come shall hear the fame of Carthon,
when they sit round the burning oak, and the night is spent in
songs of old.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ossian.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Christmas Eve</span> is chiefly spent in preparation
for the succeeding days. The housewife is
busily engaged in the provision and cooking of
dainties. The flailman still chaps in the barn,
desirous of providing the necessary store of fodder
for the Christmas. The herd-boy’s axe resounds
on the fir-stock, determined to prepare
plenty of light, and the gudeman, and others,
are abroad on a not less important errand.</p>

<p>This errand, on which we suppose the gudeman
and his assistants employed, is the procuring
of <i>Calluch Nollic</i>, or <i>Christmas Old Wife</i>,
an indispensable requisite for this occasion; and
it will perhaps puzzle some of our readers to
guess the purpose for which the good woman
is wanted. If they suppose it is to contribute
to the hilarity of the time, or to assist in the
festive preparations, the idea is not very erroneous—the
old woman does so in a very effectual
manner. But the return she meets with, however
warm, will not be admired by the reader,
when he is told that it consists in being stowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
into a cartful of burning peats, with as little
ceremony and feeling as an old broom. This
usage, so inconsistent with the Highlander’s
characteristic humanity, she does not, however,
regard as a great punishment, for her feelings
are as fire-proof as those of a Salamander. Indeed,
it is no rare sight, though strange it must
be, to see an honest woman, who has undergone
the unpleasant process of being Christmas fire
to a circle of unfeeling fellows, perhaps oftener
than once, heartily spinning at her wheel, and
gratifying those, it may be, who had a hand in the
unfriendly act, with her marvellous tales. But
to avoid a certain imputation which some may
be inclined to fix on us, it will be proper to explain
our meaning.</p>

<p>The reader will please understand, that this
good woman only undergoes this process by representation.
Among those valuable discoveries
which distinguish former ages, that which gave
rise to this custom deserves notice. Some wise-acre,
by some lucky chance, discovered, that at
this festive season, when the asperity of his character
is probably much softened, even relentless
death himself can be compromised with on very
advantageous terms. By the sacrifice of an old
woman, or any other body whom he wished in a
better world, and whom, by the following process,
he chose to send to it, death was debarred
from any farther claim to himself, or his friends,
until the return of the next anniversary. He
went to the wood this night, fetched home the
stump of some withered tree, which he regularly
constituted the representative of some person of
the description we have mentioned, and whose
doom was inevitably fixed by the process, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
resort or appeal. Such a simple mode of
obtaining security from a foe whom every body
fears, could not be supposed to fall into desuetude;
and the custom is therefore retained, whatever
faith may exist as to its utility, in some
parts of the country, even to this day.</p>

<p>But to return to the busy fireside whence we
set out, we shall suppose the goodman and the
“<i>carling</i>” arrived, and the other members of the
family now relieved from their eager toil, with
the old wife in the centre. The question now
is, how the remainder of the night is to be disposed
of? The nature of it requires that it
should be spent with gaiety; and a game at
cards, the clod,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> or the bag, is generally fixed
upon. At the ordinary hour, however, all retire
to rest with minds bent on the morrow’s gratifications,
and the house is soon changed from that
scene of bustle and confusion it recently exhibited,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
to that of peaceful tranquillity, where
nothing is heard but the slumbering of the inmates,
and the growling bark of the faithful
<i>collie</i> on the midden-head.</p>

<p>At length the brightening glow of the eastern
sky warns the anxious housemaid of the approach
of</p>

<p class="center">CHRISTMAS DAY.</p>

<p>She rises full of anxiety at the prospect of
her morning labours. The meal, which was
steeped in the <i>sowans-bowie</i> a fortnight ago, to
make the <i>Prechdachdan sour</i>, or <i>sour scones</i>, is
the first object of her attention. The gridiron
is put on the fire, and the sour scones are soon
followed by hard cakes, soft cakes, buttered
cakes, brandered bannocks, and pannich perm.
The baking being once over, the sowans pot
succeeds the gridiron, full of new sowans,
which are to be given to the family, agreeably
to custom, this day in their beds. The sowans
are boiled into the consistence of molasses,
when the <i>Lagan-le-vrich</i>,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> to distinguish it from
boiled sowans, is ready. It is then poured into
as many bickers as there are individuals to partake
of it, and presently served to the whole,
old and young. It would suit well the pen of
a Burns, or the pencil of a Cruikshank, to
paint the scene which follows. The ambrosial
food is soon dispatched in aspiring draughts by
the family, who soon give evident proofs of the
enlivening effects of the <i>Lagan-le-vrich</i>. As
soon as each dispatches his bicker, he jumps out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
of bed—the elder branches to examine the ominous
signs of the day,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> and the younger to enter
on its amusements. Flocking to the swing, a
favourite amusement on this occasion, the
youngest of the family gets the first “<i>shouden</i>,”
and the next oldest to him, in regular succession.
In order to add the more to the spirit of
the exercise, it is a common practice with the
person in the <i>swing</i>, and the person appointed
to swing him, to enter into a very warm and
humorous altercation. As the swinged person
approaches the swinger, he exclaims, <i>Ei mi tu
chal</i>, “I’ll eat your kail.” To this the swinger
replies, with a violent shove, <i>Cha ni u mu chal</i>,
“You shan’t eat my kail.” These threats and
repulses are sometimes carried to such a height
as to break down or capsize the threatener,
which generally puts an end to the quarrel.</p>

<p>As the day advances, those minor amusements
are terminated at the report of the gun,
or the rattle of the ball-clubs—the gun inviting
the marksman to the “<i>Kiavanuchd</i>,” or
prize-shooting, and the latter to “<i>Luchd-vouil</i>,”
or the ball-combatants—both the principal
sports of the day. A description of either of
these sports is unnecessary, as nothing new distinguishes
them from similar amusements in
other places; unless it be a consummate precision
in the marksman, and a vigorous intrepidity
in the ball-combatants, that cannot perhaps
be equalled by the peasantry of any other
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>Tired at length of the active amusements of
the field, they exchange them for the substantial
entertainments of the table. Groaning
under the “<i>sonsy haggis</i>,” and many other savoury
dainties, unseen perhaps for twelve months
before, the relish communicated to the company,
by the appearance of the festive board, is
more easily conceived than described. The
dinner once dispatched, the flowing bowl succeeds,
and the sparkling glass flies to and fro
like a weaver’s shuttle. As it continues its
rounds, the spirits of the company become the
more jovial and happy. Animated by its cheering
influence, even old decrepitude no longer
feels his habitual pains—the fire of youth is in
his eye, as he details to the company the exploits
which distinguished him in the days of
“<i>auld langsyne</i>;” while the young, with hearts
inflamed with “<i>love and glory</i>,” long to mingle
in the more lively scenes of mirth, to display
their prowess and agility. Leaving the patriarchs
to finish those professions of friendship
for each other, in which they are so devoutly
engaged, the younger part of the company will
shape their course to the ball-room, or the card-table,
as their individual inclinations suggest;
and the remainder of the evening is spent with
the greatest pleasure of which human nature is
susceptible. Nor will this happy evening terminate
the festivities of this occasion. Christmas
mid-day awakes all but old age, to a renewal
of former hilarity. To age, however, there is
no permanent enjoyment ordained in this sublunary
state. The transient gleam of happiness
which animated his feeble frame has given
place, with the cause of it, to a gloom proportionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
to his former joys. Headaches, rheumatisms,
and other wonted infirmities, are this
day returned with more than usual virulence.
He wakes only to recline his head on a pillow
of sorrow, and to think on the days that are
gone.</p>

<p class="center">“A gude New Year I wish thee, Maggy.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="indentleft"><span class="smcap">Burns.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Highlander’s native proneness to festive
enjoyments, far from being cloyed by recent
series of feasts and diversions, only receives from
their speedy recurrence an additional excitement.
Anxious by all means to secure this
occasion its accustomed share of hilarity, fresh
schemes of amusement are studied and promoted
with unabated avidity. The peculiar character
of the time pre-eminently entitles it to every
demonstration of satisfaction which mankind can
evince; and it must be no small stimulus to the
Highlander’s laudable zeal, to see that in this
he is imitated by beings whose abilities are far
inferior to his own.</p>

<p>We presume it is a circumstance that is very
little known in other quarters of the kingdom,
that, on this particular occasion, even the <i>brute</i>
creation (if we may use the expression) have an
instinctive knowledge of its auspices. In particular,
that admirable object of Highland curiosity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
the “<i>Candlemas</i><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> <i>Bull</i>,” manifests no small
degree of respect for the occasion. This strange
and curious <i>animal</i>, which has so long escaped
the observation of all the <i>Saxon</i> naturalists and
astronomers that ever lived, has been long since
discovered by our Highland philosophers. We
say astronomers! because, however strange it
may appear, this bull forms an object of speculation
connected with their department of science.
It must not, however, be inferred from this circumstance,
that it is of that celestial species of
bulls designated by astronomers to distinguish a
particular division of the zodiac; neither is it of
that terrestrial species known to naturalists and
cattle-dealers—it is of a species distinct from
both. Partaking together of the aërial and terrestrial
nature and qualities, both the earth and
the air are equally its elements. This bull makes
an annual excursion, in some latitude or other,
about the twilight of this night, no doubt in honour
of the occasion. He has, it is said, neither
wings nor any other apparent buoyants; but he
takes advantage of the course of the wind, on
which he glides along in fellowship with the
clouds, in a manner that would do credit to the
best aeronaut of the day. The particular place
of his ascension or descent, which varies with
the direction of the wind, cannot be exactly ascertained.
Nor can we favour the curious with
a minute description of its bodily appearance,
since we never had the good fortune to be present
when it was seen. All our informants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
however, agree in representing it as of a very
large size, the colour of a dark cloud, and having
all the limbs of a common bull.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p>As soon as night sets in, it is the signal for
the suspension of common employments; and
the Highlander’s attention is directed to more
agreeable and important callings. Associating
themselves into bands, the men, with tethers and
axes, shape their course towards the juniper
bushes, which are as much in request this night
as kail is on Hallowe’en. Returning home with
Herculean loads, the juniper is arranged around
the fire to dry till the morning. Some careful
person is also dispatched to the <i>dead and living
ford</i>, who draws a pitcher of water, observing
all the time the most profound silence. Great
care must be taken that the vessel containing
the water does not touch the ground, otherwise
it would lose all its virtues. These and every
other necessary peculiar to the occasion being
provided, the inmates retire to rest for the night,
full of the thoughts of the morrow.</p>

<p>The Highlander’s morning cheer this day is
far less palatable than that with which he is
served so comfortably on Christmas-day. But
if it be not so agreeable to his temporal inclinations,
it is far more beneficial to his spiritual interests.
The <i>Lagan-le-vrich</i>, though very good
in itself as a substantial dish, will do no more
than satisfy for a time the cravings of nature.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
But the treat of which he partakes this day extends
its effects to the good of both soul and
body. This treat, if we may so call it, is divided
into two courses, which are productive of the
following good effects.</p>

<p>The first course, consisting of the <i>Usque-Cashrichd</i>,
or water from the <i>dead and living
ford</i>, by its sacred virtues, preserves the Highlander,
until the next anniversary, from all those
direful calamities proceeding from the agency of
all infernal spirits, witchcraft, evil eyes, and the
like. And the second course, consisting of the
fumes of juniper, not only removes whatever
diseases may affect the human frame at the time,
but it likewise fortifies the constitution against
their future attacks. These courses of medicine
are administered in the following manner:—</p>

<p>Light and fire being kindled, and the necessary
arrangements having been effected, the
high priest of the ceremonies for the day, and
his assistants, proceed with the hallowed water
to the several beds in the house, and, by means
of a large brush, sprinkles upon their occupants
a profuse shower of the precious preservative,
which, notwithstanding its salutary properties,
they sometimes receive with jarring ingratitude.</p>

<p>The first course being thus served, the second
is about to be administered, preliminary to which
it is necessary to stuff all the crevices and windows
in the house, even to the key-hole. This
done, piles of juniper are kindled into a conflagration
in the different apartments of the house.
Rising in fantastic curls, the fumes of the blazing
juniper spread along the roof, and gradually
condense themselves into an opaque cloud, filling
the apartment with an odoriferous fumigation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
altogether overpowering. Penetrating into the
inmost recesses of the patient’s system, (for <i>patients</i>
they may well be called,) it brings on an
incessant shower of hiccupping, sneezing, wheezing,
and coughing, highly demonstrative of its
expectorating qualities. But it not unfrequently
happens, that young and thoughtless urchins,
not relishing such <i>physic</i>, and unmindful of the
important benefits they reap from it, diversify
the scene by cries of suffocation and the like,
which never fail to call forth from the more reflecting
part of the family, if able to speak, a
very severe reproof. Well knowing, however,
that the more intense the “<i>smuchdan</i>,” the more
propitious are its effects, the high priest, with
dripping eyes and distorted mouth, continues
his operations, regardless of the feelings of his
flock, until he considers the dose fully sufficient—upon
which he opens the <i>vent</i>, and the other
crevices, to admit the genial fluid, to recover the
spirits of the exhausted patients. He then proceeds
to gratify the horses, cattle, and other
bestial stock in the town, with the same entertainment
in their turn.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the gudewife gets up, venting
the most latent embryo of disease in a copious
expectoration; and clapping her hand upon the
bottle <i>dhu</i>, she administers a renovating cordial
to the sufferers around her. The painful ordeal
is, therefore, soon forgotten, and nothing is heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
but the salutations of the season. All the family
now get up, to wash their besmeared faces and
prepare themselves for the festivities of the day,
and for receiving the visits of their neighbours.
These last soon arrive in bodies, venting upon
the family broadsides of salutation peculiar to
the day.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> Breakfast being served up, consisting
of all the luxuries that can be procured,
those of the neighbours not engaged are invited
to partake of it; and the day is terminated with
balls, drinking, card parties, and other sports
too tedious to be mentioned.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most substantial entertainment peculiar
to this night is the matrimonial brose, which is
a dish, we believe, well known throughout the
country at large. This savoury dish is generally
made of the bree of a good fat jigget of
beef or mutton, which, being sometimes a good
while in <i>retentum</i>, renders the addition of salt
to the meal unnecessary. Before the bree is
put in the bicker or plate, a ring is mixed with
the meal, which it will be the aim of every partaker
to get. The first bicker being discussed,
the ring is put into two other bickers successively;
and should any of the candidates for
matrimony find the ring more than once, he
may rest assured of his marrying before the
next anniversary.</p>

<p>The brose, and plenty of other good cheer,
being dispatched, the guests betake themselves
to another part of the night’s entertainment.
Soon as the evening circle convenes, the “<i>Bannich
Junit</i>,” or “sauty bannocks,” are resorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
to. The component ingredients of those dainties
are eggs and meal, and a sufficient quantity
of salt, in order to sustain their ancient and
appropriate appellation of “sauty.” These ingredients,
well mixed together, are baked or
toasted on the gridiron, and are regarded by old
and young as a most delicious treat; and, as
may be expected, they have a charm attached
to them, which enables the happy Highlander
to discover the object of all his spells—his connubial
bed-fellow.</p>

<p>A sufficient number of those designed for the
palate being prepared, the great or matrimonial
bannock is made, of which all the young people
in the house partake. Into the ingredients of
it there is some particle intermixed, which, in
the distribution, will fall to the lot of some
happy person, who may be sure, if not already
married, to be so before the next anniversary.</p>

<p>Last of all are made the <i>Bannich Bruader</i>,
or dreaming bannocks, to the ingredients composing
which is added a little of that substance
which chimney-sweeps call soot, and which contains
some charm of which we have not yet
come to the knowledge. In baking these last
bannocks, the baker must be as mute as a stone—one
word would destroy the charm of the
whole concern. One is given to each individual,
who slips off with it quietly to bed; and,
reposing his head on his bannock, he will be
gratified by the sight of his beloved in the course
of his midnight slumbers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beltane Eve</span><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> is a night of considerable importance
and of much anxiety to the Highland
farmer, as being the grand anniversary review
night, on which all the tribes of witches, warlocks,
wizards, and fairies, in the kingdom, are
to be reviewed by Satan and his chief generals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
in person, and new candidates admitted into infernal
orders. When such a troop, under such
a commander, are let loose upon the community,
it is natural to suppose that much misery
and devastation will follow in their train; and
when rewards are only conferred on those most
consummate in wickedness, and those most adept
in cutting diabolical cantrips, it is natural for
every honest man to feel anxious that they may
not obtain promotion at his expense. In order,
therefore, to be perfectly secure from the machinations
of so dangerous a society, every prudent
man will resort to those safeguards that
will keep them at the staff’s end. Messengers
are therefore dispatched to the woods for cargoes
of the blessed rowan tree, the virtues of which
are well known. Being formed into the shape
of a cross, by means of a red thread, the virtues
of which too are very eminent, those crosses
are, with all due solemnity, inserted in the different
door-lintels in the town, and protect
those premises from the cantrips of the most
diabolical witch in the universe. Care should
also be taken to insert one of them in the midden,
which has at all times been a favourite site
of <i>rendezvous</i> with the black sisterhood. This
cheaply purchased precaution once observed,
the people of those countries will now go to bed
as unconcernedly, and sleep as soundly, as on
any other night.</p>

<p>While those necessary precautions are in
preparation, the matron or housekeeper is employed
in a not less interesting avocation to the
juvenile generation, <i>i. e.</i> baking the Beltane
bannocks. Next morning the children are presented
each with a bannock, with as much joy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
as an heir to an estate his title-deeds; and having
their pockets well lined with cheese and
eggs, to render the entertainment still more
sumptuous, they hasten to the place of assignation,
to meet the little band assembled on the
brow of some sloping hill, to reel their bannocks,
and learn their future fate. With hearty greetings
they meet, and with their knives make the
signs of life and death on their bannocks. These
signs are a cross, or the sign of life, on the one
side; and a cypher, or the sign of death, on the
other. This being done, the bannocks are all
arranged in a line, and on their edges let down
the hill. This process is repeated three times,
and if the cross most frequently present itself,
the owner will live to celebrate another Beltane
day; but if the cypher is oftenest uppermost,
he is doomed to die of course. This sure prophecy
of short life, however, seldom spoils the
appetites of the unfortunate short-livers, who
will handle their knives with as little signs of
death as their more fortunate companions.
Assembling around a rousing fire of collected
heath and brushwood, the ill-fated bannocks are
soon demolished, amidst the cheering and jollity
of the youthful association.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> travelled over the prominent features
which distinguish public annual festivities in
the Highlands of Scotland, we shall now briefly
direct the reader’s attention to those particular
occasions which only interest private circles of
friends; and of all these it may be said, that the
birth and christening of a child forms one of the
most pleasant and important. The fond parent,
filled with those visionary hopes and expectations
which the imagination is so apt to conceive
as the portion of those objects most dear to us,
fancies he beholds in his new offspring the future
hero or statesman, whose fragile hand may be
destined to wield the sword of a general or the
pen of a statesman. Such is the impression of
the Highland parent in particular—an impression
in which he is perhaps confirmed by superior
authority. The great utility and comfort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
derived from having the assistance of those wise
people, whose experience and judgment enable
them to discover those great destinies in an infant,
is abundantly apparent; and of this capacity
most of the Highland matrons are possessed.
It is no doubt this weighty consideration that
induces every honest woman to have her own
junto of matron counsellors, whose presence is
as indispensable on the occasion of an accouchement
as that of the <i>accoucheur</i>. If the offspring
is a son, it is likely those sage physiognomists
will already trace in his infantile lineaments
clear signs of that future greatness which he is
destined some happy day to display, as well as
the striking resemblance he bears to his father
and mother. The greatness of such a <i>blessing</i>
as this they never fail to impress upon the overjoyed
father, (though, by the bye, he may have
had too many of these blessings before,) who is
thus induced cheerfully to devote more of his
little property than he can well afford, to give
the occasion its deserved <i>eclat</i>. Filled with
pleasure, elated with hope, Highland hospitality
has no bounds—a score of lives are sacrificed at
the shrine of festivity, and all the neighbours
and kinsmen invited to the christening. The
day arrived, the little great man destined to
grace some name is arrayed in his robes of state,
and confided to the care of the happy sponsors,
who, (should the parson not attend the feast,)
together with the company present, will proceed
with him to the parsonage, to receive the ordinance
of baptism. On their return, the guests
assembled will pledge the health of their host
and the <i>Benheen</i>, or the sick wife, in overflowing
bumpers—not forgetting young Donald,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
who, “<i>may he thrive</i>,” every body praises for a
fine child.</p>

<p>The seating and tables being next sorted in
some snug place, the feast commences with a
course of savoury soup, which is pronounced
good by all. A succeeding course of broth is
still better; and a third still better than the second.
Mutton and beef follow, each good in
its kind. Plenty of fowls, equally delicious,
are next ushered in, calling forth the unqualified
praise of the guests, who, upon the whole, pronounce
the banquet the most luxurious which
they have seen for a long time before. The
dessert once dispatched, the flowing bowl succeeds,
and the rafters are made again to resound
to the healths of the young hero and his parents.
A long catalogue of those toasts and sentiments
most congenial to the feelings of the company
are next drank with the greatest glee; and bowl
after bowl is speedily drained “to <i>friendship’s
growth</i>,” the effects of which bespeak themselves
in the aspect of the company.</p>

<p>Enveloped in a cloud of tobacco-smoke, in
one corner a hamlet politician is retailing to his
half-attentive neighbour the various news of the
day. Another guest is as warmly engaged in the
praise of his wife, his horses, or his cattle; and
another is eagerly soliciting attention to his improved
mode of ploughing his ground, sowing
his turnips, and planting his potatoes. At length,
when the house begins to revolve, each thinks
it time to withdraw. The officious midwife
then comes to the door, full of kind inquiries, if
each has got his own plaid, bonnet, and staff;
and being rewarded for her attention by the customary
<i>douceur</i>, she wishes them all a good night
and a pleasant journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Interesting</span> as a christening undoubtedly is
to the parents of the child, it is, neither in a
public nor private sense, so happy an occasion
as that which we are about to describe. If there
is any thing under the sun in which true happiness
really consists, we are told it is in the consummation
of a marriage, where the parties,
uninfluenced by sordid motives, are entirely
brought together by the magnetic power of love.
Of such a description the Highland marriages
are in general. The lower classes being pretty
equal in their circumstances, policy and interest
have less influence in their marriages than is the
case with any other rank of people; and consequently
the parties are left more to the unbiassed
dictates of their own voluntary choice.</p>

<p>When a couple of young lovers propose to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
get married, the nearest relations of both parties
meet to take the case into consideration; and,
in general, it is no difficult matter for the lovers
and their advocates to get a decision consonant
to their inclinations. This is called the booking
(“<i>leuruch</i>”) or contract, which is very often ratified
by no other covenant than a few bottles of
whisky. If the parties come to an understanding,
the lovers are immediately declared bride
and bridegroom; and some Tuesday or Thursday
in the growth of the moon is fixed upon for
the celebration of the nuptials. Meanwhile, to
sustain the dignity of the bridal pair, from motives
of policy as well as of state, they select
from their kinsmen two trustworthy persons
each, who are delegated to the other—the male
to protect the party from being stolen, (a practice
once common, and not yet extinct,) and the
female to act as maid of honour and lady of the
bedchamber on the bridal occasion.</p>

<p>A few days prior to the bridal day, the parties,
with their attendants, perambulate the
country, inviting the guests, on which occasion
they meet with marked attention from old and
young. The invitations are all delivered to the
parties <i>propria persona</i> at their firesides; and if
the wedding is to be a cheap one, a small present
is sometimes offered to the bride, and accepted
of.</p>

<p>On the morning of the wedding-day, some
lady, who is above the ordinary level, and who
has been constituted mistress of the ceremonies
for the day, arrives to deck the bride in her
splendid habiliments. She is received by the
clean white bride, previously prepared for her
by a ducking in the cold bath; and, retiring to
the wardrobe chamber, she is speedily metamorphosed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
from a “sonsy country lassie” into a
downright lady—at least, if muslins and ribbons
are all that is requisite to confer this distinction,
she is entitled to it. The bridegroom, too, at
his apartments, has his own decorators, who
deck him out most splendidly with marriage
favours and other ornaments suitable to the occasion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, repeated vollies of musketry summon
the guests to the wedding. Mounted on
his palfry, each “crony” shapes his course to
the house to which he was invited; while droves
of youngsters flock along the road, whose hearts
at every shot are bounding with joy. On their
arrival, they are ushered into the breakfasting
apartment, to partake of the forenoon’s entertainment,
consisting of good milk porridge and
cream, on which they fare very sumptuously.
After this mid-day repast, they are led to the
ball-room, or dancing apartment, to share in its
enjoyment. Here the bride or bridegroom is
seated at the upper end of the ball-room, and
receives the company, as they successively arrive,
with great pomp and ceremony; and the dancing
and mirth is prolonged for some hours.</p>

<p>At the time appointed, the bridegroom selects
a party of young men, who are dispatched to
summon the bride and her party to the marriage
ceremony. Their approach is announced by
showers of musketry opened upon them by
some of the bride’s men, and returned, most of
the guests being furnished with pistols. The
bride’s party accordingly prepare themselves for
the procession. The bride is mounted upon
some <i>canny</i> charger behind an expert rider;
drams go round to her health and prosperity;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
and, the company being all in readiness, she
leaves her native residence for another, amidst
the cheers and <i>feu-de-joie</i> of the assembly.
Marching to the sound of the inspiring bagpipes,
and the discharge of fire-arms, the bride’s
party proceed to the place appointed for the
marriage. The bridegroom’s party follow at
some little distance; and both arrived at the
appointed place of rendezvous, the bridegroom’s
party stand in the rear till the bride’s party
enter the meeting-house, agreeably to the rules
of precedence, which on this occasion are decidedly
in favour of the bride in all the proceedings
of the day.</p>

<p>Soon as the hymeneal knot is tied, the candidates
for the honour of wonning the kail, as
they call it, drive off <i>pell mell</i> for the bridegroom’s
house, horsemen and footmen promiscuously.
Both parties, now mingled together, proceed
with multitudinous jovialty towards the
bridegroom’s, the scene of the future festivities
of the night. A volley of fire-arms announces
their arrival; and the company assembled at the
door, to welcome the bride, assail her with a
basket of the bridal bread and cheese, the properties
of which are well known. The bridal
pair are then seated at the upper end of the
banquet, and the guests are arrayed, according
to their quality, around the far-extended tables,
formed of doors, chests, and cart bottoms, sustained
by sturdy supporters of wood or stone;
and wooden beams, and deals for chairs, in common
form. The more plebeian part of the
guests, freely disposed of in the stables or byres,
make themselves very comfortable with their
cheer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>Shortly the waiters come round the circle,
presenting each with a spoon, which he must
carefully return when done with it. The spoon
is followed with the hardly-contested kail.
After this, a remove of savoury broth is presently
brought in; of which all having partaken,
the still more delicious “<i>hotch-potch</i>” succeeds.
Then follow fowl of every feather, and every
beast and creeping thing—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Hind and fore spalls of a sheep</div>
<div class="indent">Drew whittles frae ilk sheath;</div>
<div class="verse">Wi’ gravie a’ their beards did creep,</div>
<div class="indent">They kempit wi’ their teeth.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The dinner being over, the “shemit reel” is
the next object of attention. All the company
assemble on the lawn with flambeaux, and form
into a circle. The bridal pair and their retinue
then dance a <i>sixsome reel</i>, each putting a piece
of silver into the musician’s hand. Those desirous
may then succeed, and dance with the
bride and the two maids of honour, and are
gratified at the commencement and termination
of each reel by the usual salutes.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the stewards of the feast
having removed the temporary erections from
the dancing apartments, the shemit reel being
over, the guests re-occupy their seats in the original
order, and dancing and mirth is again resumed.
Tartan plaids, spreading in every corner,
invite the fair to take shelter in those most
congenial to their inclinations. The jovial smiling
bowl, now reeking in a corner, allures to its
side its votaries—the circling glass adds additional
stimulus to the riotous spirit of the company.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
In short, pleasure presents herself for
courtship in all her luring forms.</p>

<p>As the night advances, the company grows
still more happy. The numerous ills of the
human lot, which at other times so much afflict
them, now cause them no concern; on the contrary,
they are entirely full of its pleasures.
Hence, all the corners of the house, instead of
declamations against the infirmities of age, or
the badness of the times, are full of the happiest
communications. Opportunities long sought for
declaring secret friendship have now occurred,
and the warmth with which they are expressed
forcibly bespeak their fervency. Two patriarchs
“had long indulged the hope of seeing an honourable
alliance betwixt <i>their</i> families. Both
honest and respectable, the union of their children
would be a highly suitable match; and
should such a desirable event ever occur, there
was a black stocking in secret, which would
spew on the occasion of the wedding.” In another,
you may see two hearty grey-beards, whose
locked hands and contacting noddles show the
closeness of their friendship, relating to each
other, with much complacency, those tales of
“<i>auld langsyne</i>” in which they themselves acted
so prominent a part. In another corner, the
fond lover, with his dearly beloved locked in his
affectionate embrace, melting her heart with his
wooing strains; and in another, the vocal choir,
whose throats of steel vociferate their harmonious
ditties on the gratified ears of the company;
while, on the top of a bed, or at the back of the
door, the juvenile part of the guests, assembled
in tumultuous rabble, will also join their voices
in the general uproar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>On the floor the dancers are beyond compare.
Fixed with emulation who shall <i>win the dance</i>,
every nerve and muscle is put in active exercise.
The lads are gaining greater agility every
successive reel; while, in the language of the
poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The lasses bab’d about the reel,</div>
<div class="indent">Gart a’ their hurdies wallop,</div>
<div class="verse">And swat like ponies when they speel</div>
<div class="indent">Up braes, or when they gallop.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>This scene lasts for some hours, until the presence
of day warns the bride to prepare for the
bedding. Wishing, if possible, to elude the
public gaze, she attempts to steal away privately,
when, observed by some vigilant eye, her departure
is announced, and all push to the bridal
chamber.</p>

<p>The door is instantly forced open, and the
devoted bride, divested of all her braws, and
stripped nearly to the state of nature, is placed
in bed in presence of the whole company. Her
left stocking is then flung, and falls upon some
individual, whose turn to the hymeneal altar will
be the next. The bridegroom, next led in, is
as rapidly demolished, and cosily stowed along-side
of his darling. A bottle and glass being
then handed to the bridegroom, he rewards the
friendliness of those who come forward to offer
their congratulations, with a flowing bumper.
When the numerous levée have severally paid
their court, they retire, and leave the young
couple to repose.</p>

<p>On returning to the grand scene of festivity,
we shall find that the aspect of the company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
there has suffered no small alteration during
our absence. Overpowered by the peculiar influence
of the ardent friendship which fills the
elder branches of the company, those boisterous
expressions of esteem which recently occupied
them so much, have declined into the calmest
complacency. Overcome by the most unspeakable
sensations, the tongue, which was lately so
voluble, has totally failed. Those legs, which
but a few hours ago displayed the greatest agility,
have now refused their office; and the
whole machine is become perfectly unwieldy
and unmanageable:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“In their mawes there was na mank;</div>
<div class="indent">Upon the firms some snor’d;</div>
<div class="verse">Ithers frae aff the bunkers sank,</div>
<div class="indent">Wi’ een like collops scor’d.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Seated by the victorious bowl, the <i>Far Cuil</i> is
still engaged in his musical vocation. With
bow alternately above and below the strings,
he is earnestly employed at <i>Tullochgorum</i>, while
cries for the same spring, proceeding from the
dancers on the floor, incessantly ring on his
ears. Insensible to time or measure, some of
the young people still wallop on the floor, and
unabated clamour reigns throughout the house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all the avenues leading from the
town are thronged with retiring guests “<i>careering</i>”
on their way home; and the company is
ultimately reduced to the immediate friends and
relations of the young couple, who wait to offer
their morning congratulations. When the bridal
pair are supposed to have reposed themselves
sufficiently long, they are warned to get up, to
prepare for the breakfast and the morning levée.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
On entering the grand breakfasting parlour, the
whole concourse of friends receive them with
showers of compliments and congratulations,
accompanied by such gifts as may be convenient;
and yesterday’s scene of festivity is again renewed,
and prolonged for the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Short</span> and unstable are the joys of man!—How
often does it happen that such ardent scenes of
pleasure as we have been just endeavouring to
describe are but like the gleam which precedes
the storm—a prelude to direful woe! Oft has
the tender parent or loving child, who but yesterday
animated such a scene of festivity, to-day
exhibited the most desponding spectacle which
human nature can witness. Those eyes, which
then sparkled at the <i>pibroch’s</i> harmonious sounds,
are now sealed for ever; and his relations and
friends are involved in grief more vehement than
their former joys.</p>

<p>Prone to partake in his neighbour’s joys, the
Highlander, on such occasions as this, is equally
ready to share in his sorrows, and will not
grudge to contribute his exertions, by night as
well as by day, to add to his comfort or consolation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
On the last offices of friendship being
performed, the body is laid on a bed in that
apartment of the house most commodious and
suitable for the company; and the neighbours
immediately collect in bands, to watch over the
remains of departed friendship. During the
silent hours of midnight, the solemnity of the
occasion is heightened by the sound of sacred
praise, and reading of the blessed Gospel. Such
are now the laudable employments which have
assumed the place of that revelry which formerly
disgraced the Highland wakes, when immoderate
drinking, dancing, wanton levity, and profane
amusements, were the prominent features of
such an assembly. It is true, the moderate use
of liquor and singing of songs are still tolerated,
but excess on these occasions is now unknown.
On the departure of every group, one of the
friends in attendance conducts them to the
melancholy bier, when each generally testifies
the ardour of his friendship by shaking the
hand, which now cannot feel his proffered kindness,
and retires full of those solemn reflections
which the scene is calculated to produce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the third day after the defunct’s decease, if
the person occupied no station above the ordinary
level, the body will be led to its destined
abode. This sorrowful day is early distinguished
by melancholy arrangements. Verbal warnings
having been previously circulated to the male
inhabitants of the district, large and timeous
preparations are necessary for their accommodation
and entertainment. While the seating of
the apartments destined to receive the company
occupies the men, the arrangement of the entertainment
occupies no less the attention of the
women. In the meanwhile, the relations and
family of the deceased attire themselves in the
best mournings their circumstances can afford,
and prepare themselves for going through the
duties of the day with all possible fortitude and
decency. The arrival of the wooden house of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
death, and the deposition of its inhabitant,
early call forth many a sigh and tear at the
parting which is about to take place. But the
closing of the coffin is deferred till the eve of
removal.</p>

<p>About twelve o’clock, the company, or, to
speak more properly, the guests, successively
arrive in scattered groups, dressed in all the
variegated colours of the rainbow; and are received
by some near connection of the deceased,
who conducts them to the place appointed for
their station.</p>

<p>With becoming gravity they take their seats,
condoling very feelingly with the present friends
on their lamentable loss, and carry on for a
while a conversation very suitable to the business
which brought them together. They are
each served, on their arrival, with what is called
a dram of “<i>dry whisky</i>,” and some fit person is
appointed to keep the glass in active circulation.
To him is also delegated a discretionary power
of imposing extra penalties on late comers, who
must compensate for their absence by drinking
a double quantity on their arrival.</p>

<p>Thus, all equally well plied with the enlivening
glass, the solemn aspect of the company is
soon changed into a mixture of sorrow and joy.
The moralist, who so recently uttered such sage
reflections upon the shortness of life and its
uncertainty, is transformed by some secret
influence into the sprightly wit, whose humorous
jokes and repartees continually agitate the
risible powers of his audience. In short, the
house of mourning is rapidly changing into a
house of mirth; and such would be the opinion
of any stranger who might visit the scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>As soon as he approaches the door of the
<i>meeting-house</i>, his ears are assailed with a confusion
of sounds, which conveys to him the idea
of entering a house full of bees. Seated in
double rows, extending from one end of the
house to the other, he finds it literally crammed,
not with bees, but Highlandmen of every age
and condition. In each end of the house he
sees overflowing bowls, and walking to and fro,
a host of waiters, bearing the full and empty
glasses of the company, followed by others with
bread and cheese, which are liberally distributed
amongst the guests. Being seated in the place
befitting his rank or station, if curiosity leads
him to a closer examination of the complexion
of his company, he will not be a little amused
at the diversity of feelings and conversation distinguishing
the individuals composing it. If the
visitor or stranger whom we have supposed is of
a serious cast of mind, and if he addresses himself
to his elbow neighbour on the solemn character
of the occasion, and laments the pitiful
state of the family that may be thus deprived of
their parent or provider—perhaps, if he listens
for a moment with counterfeited seriousness, the
sprightly sally of a rustic wit rings upon his ear,
and a horse-laugh immediately shows the spectator
he has no great relish for his subject. If,
again, he addresses himself to one of a less jovial
temperament, who has not yet been so much
affected by the general <i>infection</i> upon the same
subject, he will perhaps acknowledge the justness
of his observations with a significant shake
of the head, declaring at the same time the
poignancy of his sorrow for the deceased, who,
“new peace to him, was the best of souls.” But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
at the same time, and in the same breath, he
will make a digression to the alarming depreciation
of agricultural produce, and the consequent
inevitable ruin of poor farmers, if they do not
immediately get a reduction of the one-half of
their rents; and the concern he evinces for both
matters makes it difficult to determine which
loss he considers the greater calamity. Listening
to the various topics of conversation discussed
by the company in general, he will find <i>seriousness</i>
form no part of it. Having already sufficiently
moralized on the <i>evils</i> of life, they are
now resolved to confine themselves entirely to
its <i>goods</i>. Death, low prices, and high rents,
have now given place to balls, feasts, and diversions.
One group is warmly engaged in scheming
a “<i>dry or wet ball</i>;” another group is warmly
expatiating upon the good signs of the year,
corroborated as they are by the “<i>annual prognostic</i>;”
and others are as warmly engaged in
recriminating each other for their notorious gallantries,
and the like; while a good spring, a
good harvest, and ready sale to sheep and cattle,
are drunk by all with the greatest enthusiasm.
All are become suddenly acquainted with the
proverb, “A pound of care will not pay an
ounce of debt;” and therefore they are determined
to spend life in friendship and good hopes.
In obedience to this wholesome resolution, each
crony, as he gives his neighbour the hand, will
also give him the pipe or the “sneeshan mill,”
and would be very sorry to see him ill-used in a
“<i>pley</i>,” or any such cause, without rendering
him a helping hand.</p>

<p>As the drinking continues, the company
become still more noisy. Repetitions of toasts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the vacant laugh, and incoherent exclamation,
mingled with a few little oaths, are what perpetually
burst upon the ear; and the sequel of
such unhallowed carousals exhibit but too frequently
a scene of the most improper levity.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></p>

<p>Far different, however, are the feelings and
conduct of those mournful individuals who
occupy another apartment, where the affectionate
widow or fatherless orphans are now assembled,
to take the last and long farewell of the relics of
love. In deep dismay, behold the sorrowing
group bending over the dear remains, absorbed
in frantic woe, bathing with their tears unfeeling
death, insensible to all their sorrows.</p>

<p>When the weeping relatives have severally
bade the corpse the last adieu, by imparting the
farewell kiss to the cold and pallid lip of death,
(which, nevertheless, is perhaps the sweetest we
ever impart,) the dearest form is for ever concealed
from their view.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Long on the lip the kiss will dwell,</div>
<div class="indent">And on the ear the mournful sigh,</div>
<div class="verse">Which seal’d the last and fond farewell,</div>
<div class="indent">And forg’d a bond time can’t untie.”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>The necessary arrangements being effected,
the coffin is brought forth, surrounded by the
bereaved friends, and bound on the <i>hanspecks</i>
on some convenient supports at the door; and
when time will no longer permit the guests to
indulge in their hilarity, an unwelcome summons
invites them to their duty. Issuing forth tumultuously,
they surround their charge; and all
the riders being provided with their horses, the
signal for setting off is given. The female relations,
according to the custom of some countries,
get the first lift; and the supports on which the
body was bound being carefully overturned, for
some reason best known to the wise men of the
day, the multitudinous procession takes the road.</p>

<p>At this moment a scene presents itself to the
cool spectator, wholly without a parallel. The
various habiliments of the company—riders and
pedestrians mingled together—the sound of the
horses—and the united clamour of the multitude—are
altogether striking. At one time, the
expressions of mirth predominate; while, at
others, the heart-rending lamentations of the
female relations of the defunct prevail, and in
their turn vibrate upon the ear. The women,
at length unwillingly disentangled from the
body, return home with mournful wailing, and
the procession continues its course to its destination.
Too many of the company are sometimes
more intent upon their own pleasures
than mindful of their business, roving about in
scattered parties; while others exhibit, in their
attention, a pattern of correctness and decorum;
and, warmly enumerating the good qualities of
the deceased, descant on the happy change he
has made—at the same time walking with a careful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
step, lest an unfortunate fall beneath the
body should doom themselves to share his enviable
lot.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a></p>

<p>At length, arrived at the mansions of the
dead, the body is lowered into its drear abode,
amidst the sorrowing of some and the insensibility
of others. The slate planted on the grave
terminates its earthly career, and consigns it for
ever to the land of forgetfulness.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> Nothing can appear more surprising to the refined reader,
than that any human being, possessing the rational faculties
of human nature, could for a moment entertain a notion so
preposterous as that a ghost, which conveys the idea of an immortal
spirit, could be killed, or rather annihilated, by an arrow,
dirk, or sixpence. It was, however, the opinion of the darker
ages, that such an exploit as killing a ghost was perfectly
practicable. A spirit was supposed to be material in its nature,
quite susceptible of mortal pain, and liable to death or annihilation
from the weapons of man. Such an opinion is repeatedly
expressed in several passages of the Poems of Ossian, and in
the doctrine of the <i>Seanachy</i>, down to the present day.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[C]</a> We are informed that there is a woman still living in the
parish of Abernethy, on whom this experiment was tried. She
was found one night, rather unaccountably, as it appeared to
her wise parents, on the outside of a window. No doubt, therefore,
remained, but that she had been stolen by the fairies, and
a stock left as her substitute. It was, therefore, unanimously
resolved to carry the stock to the junction of the shires of Inverness,
Moray, and Banff, where the poor child was left for a
night to enjoy the pleasures of solitude. Being well rolled up
in a comfortable blanket, she sustained no material injury from
this monstrous exposure, and, accordingly, the result proved
highly satisfactory to her enlightened guardians.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[I]</a> North.</p>

<p>Since the first publication of this book, the renowned
Mr. Mac Grigor Willox has been laid with his fathers, leaving
the stone and bridle to his son and daughter, as heirlooms for
the benefit of posterity. The goodman died full of years, if
not full of any thing else which is coveted by the people of
this world. But by his death it is believed that the spell which
so long bound the northern community to his stone and bridle
has been broken; and it is thought that those precious relics,
which were scarcely “honestly come by,” may be returned
to the kelpie and the mermaid, their original owners, should
they or their representatives be disposed to claim restitution of
them.</p>

<p>The highly curious and interesting collection of Criminal
Trials, recently published by Robert Pitcairn, Esq., affords
ample particulars of the <i>modus operandi</i> by which the workers
of Satan in human shape accomplished their nefarious ends. The
reader is particularly referred to the cases of those witches of
quality, Lady Glammis and Lady Munro of Fowlis, and to the
assistant hags of the latter, consisting of Laskie Loncart, Christy
Ross, and others, all highly deserving of <i>record</i>. But Isobel
Gowdie, the head witch of Auldearn, who, on her own confession,
was condemned to be “worried and burned at a stake”
in 1662, is the standard authority to refer to on these subjects.
It appears that in those days Auldearn, near Nairn, now the
locality of a virtuous community, was the great nursery that
supplied Satan with <i>cadets</i> for his “Black Watch;” for so numerous
were the members of the craft at that place, according to
Isobel Gowdie, that on occasions of public inspection by the
sovereign of the order, they were counted or told off in <i>squads</i>
or “<i>covines</i>” (as Isobel called them), to each of which were
appointed two <i>adjutants</i> or <i>drill-sergeants</i>, the brigade-major
being a “<i>well-favoured</i>” wench of the name of “<i>Nannie</i>,” who
occupied the seat of honour at Satan’s <i>carousals</i>. On such occasions
of assembly, they dug up graves, possessed themselves
of unchristened infants, using their joints and members in their
incantations. They metamorphosed themselves into the forms
of crows, cats, hares, &amp;c., and played all manners of cantrips
on live stock and farm produce. But it not unfrequently
happened that those <i>amusements</i> turned out but indifferent
<i>sport</i> to some of the <i>probationers</i> concerned,—several worthies,
and Isobel Gowdie among the rest, having had unwittingly
become the subjects of the <i>chase</i>, at the feet and mouths of
the greyhounds of the day, who have “no respect of persons,”
or the characters in which they enacted their parts. And it
would also appear that the cadets in this Royal Military
College formed any thing but an harmonious society—the
Master General, and his <i>Sappers</i> and <i>Miners</i>, often quarrelling
about very minor matters, such as titles of distinction; in the
course of which the <i>master</i> often received many <i>black names</i>,
and the apprentices many <i>stripes</i>. But it would appear that
“one Margaret Wilson in Auldearn” was nearly match for
him; for Isobel Gowdie declares she used to “<i>bell the cat</i>”
with him stoutly; “defending herself finely” from the <i>wool-cards</i>
and such other sharp instruments of punishment as he
made use of on those occasions. “It was no doubt one of those
ancient <i>covines</i> that encountered Macbeth (not far from the
College) on his way to Forres.”</p>

<p>But since the days of Isobel Gowdie, Maggy Wilson, Bessy
Hay, and Co, the <i>union</i> has been repealed, without the aid of
any great agitator; for ever since their day, the people in this
parish have died a natural death. But it is still mooted, “<i>sotto
voce</i>,” that there are still some roots of the old tree scattered
over neighbouring territories not far from the capital of the
Highlands, who have been allowed to live quite as long as they
deserved. And one Isabella Hay, probably a descendant of
her namesake of Auldearn, has for many years levied <i>blackmail</i>
on the inhabitants of Inverness, until having, by her imps,
in autumn 1839, laid her enchantments on the goods and chattels
of some people in Inverness (the author among the number),
she was sentenced in September, 1839, by the Circuit Court of
Justiciary—not to the <i>stake</i>, but to a punishment which, however,
has served to put an end to her sorceries.</p>

<p>Among recent discoveries of the author as charms, or rather
counter-charms against witchcraft, it deserves to be noticed, that
if a knot tied against the sun be made on the tail of a quadruped,
it is secure against the spells of necromancy. It is, or
had been till recently, also a common practice to put a portion
of the medicinal herb or plant called “<i>saffron</i>” under the churn
while the process of churning the cream is undergoing, which
will prevent the <i>craft</i> from taking the substance by means of
their magical <i>rope</i>, by the operations of which they were wont
to extract from a piece of wood in their own dwellings the soul
and substance of what might belong to parties afar off, and
who, without such precaution, might churn away till doomsday
without the appearance of the yellow treasure. And
moistening the mouth of a calf with the extract of the said
vegetable, and setting it to suck a cow whose milk might go to
the said <i>rope</i>, will instantly restore it to the proper owner.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be added, in conclusion, that <i>scoring</i> a witch
crosswise on the forehead, or above her breath, divests her of
all supernatural power. But the laws are now so strong, even
at John-o’-Groat’s house, that the processes of trial by <i>swimming</i>
and <i>scoring</i> cannot now be resorted to, except in <i>extreme</i>
cases where the <i>subjects</i> have not the benefit of <i>law</i> or <i>clergy</i>.
On a very recent occasion, however, in Ross-shire, a worthy
fisher, whose nets suffered no small prejudice from the machinations
of a neighbour, but no friend, performed on her, much
against her consent, the operation of <i>scoring</i> on the forehead,
for which the sheriff of Ross, in August 1845, sentenced him to
undergo a short imprisonment in the gaol of Tain.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[K]</a> The game called “<i>Clodhan</i>,” or Clod, is a favourite
amusement with the youth in the Highlands. One of the
company goes round the circle with a clod, or some other
article, putting his hand into each person’s lap or hand, and
leaves the clod with one of the number. The whole circle
are then desired to guess the person who possesses the clod, (he
guessing like the rest to prevent suspicion,) when all those who
err are subjected to a small penalty, which shall be afterwards
determined by an appointed judge; and in the meantime, he
must deliver some pledge to enforce his compliance with the
arbiter’s decision. When a sufficient number of pledges are
obtained, judgment is pronounced against their owners, who
must redeem them, by doing various little penances, some of
which are sufficiently ludicrous.</p>

<p>The bag is another popular juvenile amusement. One pops
his head into a bag, holding his hand spread on his back, and
the palm uppermost. One of the company, in rotation, strikes
his hand, not unfrequently with all his might, upon that of the
person in the bag, who is desired to guess who struck him last.
If his guessing proves correct, the last striker then puts his
head in the bag in his turn.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[M]</a> “A black Christmas makes a fat kirk-yard.” A windy
Christmas and a calm Candlemas, or new year, are signs of a
good year.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[N]</a> The term <i>Candlemas</i> is applied to the <i>New Year</i> in the
Highlands. The origin of the term arose from some old religious
ceremonies performed on this occasion by candle-light.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[O]</a> We are totally unable to account for the origin of this
strange piece of superstition. It is unnecessary to remark, that
the object of this delusion is nothing but a passing cloud, which
the perverted imagination of the original Highlander shapes
into the form of a bull. There is something very ominous as
to the art or direction in which the bull rises or falls—we
believe it to be prognostic of its being a good or bad year.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[P]</a> It is believed that this extraordinary entertainment is now
administered in no part of the Highlands, except in Strathdown
and its immediate neighbourhood. In that district, however,
the inhabitants generally attend to it, merely, it is believed,
from the influence of inveterate custom, and the author in his
day had his share of the antidote, though it is doubtful whether
those rites are now observed in his native district.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[Q]</a> The literal expressions used in the salutation applicable to
this day in the Gaelic language the writer could never perfectly
comprehend. The literal translation of the words are, (<i>Mu
nasc choil orst</i>,) “My Candlemas bond upon you.” The real
meaning of the words, however, is, “You owe me a New-Year’s
gift;” and it is a point of great emulation who will salute the
other first—the one who does so being considered entitled to a
gift from the person so saluted.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[R]</a> Beltane is derived from two Gaelic words conjoined:
“<i>Paletein</i>,” signifying Pale’s fire, and not <i>Baal’s fire</i>, as some
suppose. The strange relic of Pagan idolatry which gave rise
to this feast was no doubt introduced into these countries, like
many others of our more prominent superstitions, by the
Druids. Pales (of whom we read in the heathenish mythologies)
was the goddess of shepherds, and protectress of flocks.
Her feast was always celebrated in the month of April, on
which occasion no victim was killed, and nothing was offered
but the fruits of the earth. The shepherds purified their flocks
with the smoke of sulphur, juniper, boxwood, rosemary, &amp;c.
They then made a large fire, round which they danced, and
offered to the goddess milk, cheese, eggs, &amp;c., holding their
faces towards the east, and uttering ejaculations peculiar to the
occasion. Those interesting relics of the religious opinions of
our ancestors, until of late, remained pretty entire in some
parts of the Highlands. But they have now, however, declined
into those childish ceremonies above described.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[S]</a> Mr. Pennant, in his Tour, vol. i. p. 111, notices the ceremony
of the Bolteen or Beltane—the cakes baken with scrupulous
attention to rites and forms, and dedicated to birds of prey,
&amp;c., or the being whose agents they were, to propitiate them to
spare the lives of themselves and flocks. Within the last
twenty or thirty years these observances have almost wholly
disappeared. But the author himself is old enough to have
reeled his bannock, and dived, by the foregoing spells, into the
secrets of futurity.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[T]</a> Let not the Highland reader be led to view this description
of a Highland funeral as casting any reflection on his
moral or religious character. Whatever ill-timed levity he may
manifest on such an occasion, the blame must be ascribed, not
to him, but to that <i>evil spirit</i>, the usquebaugh, the real cause
of it. We cannot, however, help regretting, that either the
ill-judged hospitality of the entertainer, or his own social habits,
should expose him on this particular occasion to the unruly
influence of his demoralising countryman; and we are glad to
add, that of late years much improvement has been effected in
the conduct of Highland funerals—sobriety and decorum being
much more the order of the day.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[U]</a> A fall sustained by a person, while supporting the body, is
ominous of the person’s speedy death. It may also be remarked,
that it is considered very imprudent to look at a passing funeral
from the door of a house, or from the window having a <i>stone
lintel</i>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
